# Data Portfolio

This portfolio consolidates all data-related projects I have completed, with a majority of projects coming from undergraduate Information Science course projects at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Projects range from parsing and web crawling scripts written in Python(Selenium), to multi-level data anlaysis reports (engagement, time-series, topical analysis) using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
