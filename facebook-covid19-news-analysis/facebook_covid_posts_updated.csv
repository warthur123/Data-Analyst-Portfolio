Beginning in the 1930s, federal officials enrolled hundreds of Black men in Tuskegee in an experiment to examine the effects of untreated syphilis. The men were told they were being treated for “bad blood,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, the infected were left to suffer and die from syphilis, decades after treatment existed.  Black residents say the pain and distrust fomented by this study are inseparable from their personal deliberations over whether to take a Covid-19 vaccine.  At Tuskegee’s farmers market on a recent morning, David Banks said he won’t get the shot because he doesn’t trust those administering it. The 67-year-old said some neighbors have said they suspect the first dose of a two-shot regimen is used to infect a person, and the second to see if they are cured.  “It’s cynical,” he said. “But like I said, they have reason to be.”  Read more: https://on.wsj.com/3kqvwpP  Photos by Lynsey Weatherspoon for WSJ"

There, auctioneers are peddling parcels of land to farmers eager to cash in on the best commodity prices in nearly a decade. They are also presiding over intense jockeying for fields that can test the fabric of rural communities as a shrinking set of growers compete for control of the nation’s prime soil.⁠  Farmland managers say more people are vying for land, and that some parcels are selling at—or above—prices seen during the previous farm boom nearly a decade ago. Farmland values rose during 2020 as soaring grain prices last fall revived farmers’ fortunes, according to February reports from three regional Federal Reserve Banks. Many agricultural lenders surveyed by the banks expected farmland values to rise this year as well.⁠  Kansas farmer Cole Carpenter, shown in the clip here, says he works hard to hang onto the land he leases, recently investing in technology to provide landowners with real-time, personalized data on how many bushels he harvested or acres he sprayed with fertilizer in a given wheat field. Still, he fears his ground will be the next target of a large farmer in his area, who is quickly amassing acreage.⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ “The big are getting bigger, and the rest of us are trying to hold our own,” he said.⁠  Read more: https://on.wsj.com/3fyyPe7  Video: Katie Klann for WSJ"
