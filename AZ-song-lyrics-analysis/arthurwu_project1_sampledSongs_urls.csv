I'm blowin' down this old dusty road
I'm a-blowin' down this old dusty road
I'm a-blowin' down this old dusty road; Lord; Lord
An' I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

I'm a-goin' where the water taste like wine

I'm a-goin' where the water taste like wine; Lord
An' I ain't a-gonna be treated this way

I'm a-goin' where the dust storms never blow

I'm a-goin' where them dust storms never blow; blow; blow

Yes; they say I'm a dust bowl refugee

I'm a-lookin' for a job at honest pay
I'm a-lookin' for a job at honest pay
I'm a-lookin' for a job at honest pay; Lord; Lord
An' I ain't a-gonna be treated this way

My children need three square meals a day
Now; my children need three square meals a day
My children need three square meals a day; Lord
An' I ain't a-gonna be treated this way

It takes a ten-dollar shoe to fit my feet
It takes a ten-dollar shoe to fit my feet
It takes a ten-dollar shoe to fit my feet; Lord; Lord
An' I ain't a-gonna be treated this way

You're a-two-dollar shoe hurts my feet
Your two-dollar shoe hurts my feet
Yes; your two-dollar shoe hurts my feet; Lord; Lord

Woody Guthrie,"Tom Joad, Part 2",1940,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/tomjoadpart2.html,"

The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp
There they cooked a stew
And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp
Said; ""We'd like to have some; too""
Said; ""We'd like to have some; too""

Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man
Shot a woman in the back
Before he could take his aim again
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track; poor boy
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track

They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail
And then he got away
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge
And these few words he did say; poor boy
These few words he did say

""I preached for the Lord a mighty long time
Preached about the rich and the poor
Us workin' folkses; all get together
'Cause we ain't got a chance anymore
We ain't got a chance anymore""

Now; the deputies come; and Tom and Casey run
To the bridge where the water run down
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground; poor Casey
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground

Tom Joad; he grabbed that deputy's club
Hit him over the head
Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night
And a deputy and a preacher lying dead; two men
A deputy and a preacher lying dead

Tom run back where his mother was asleep
He woke her up out of bed
An' he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved
Said what Preacher Casey said; Tom Joad
He said what Preacher Casey said

""Ever'body might be just one big soul
Well it looks that a-way to me
Everywhere that you look; in the day or night
That's where I'm a-gonna be; Ma
That's where I'm a-gonna be

Wherever little children are hungry and cry
Wherever people ain't free
Wherever men are fightin' for their rights
That's where I'm a-gonna be; Ma
That's where I'm a-gonna be""

Woody Guthrie,The Great Dust Storm (Dust Storm Disaster),1940,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/thegreatduststormduststormdisaster.html,"

On the 14th day of April of 1935
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky
You could see that dust storm comin'; the cloud looked deathlike black
And through our mighty nation; it left a dreadful track
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down
We thought it was our judgement; we thought it was our doom

The radio reported; we listened with alarm
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm
From Albuquerque and Clovis; and all New Mexico
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw

From old Dodge City; Kansas; the dust had rung their knell
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill
From Denver; Colorado; they said it blew so strong
They thought that they could hold out; but they didn't know how long

Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks
And the family it was crowded into their little room
They thought the world had ended; and they thought it was their doom

The storm took place at sundown; it lasted through the night
When we looked out next morning; we saw a terrible sight
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown

It covered up our fences; it covered up our barns
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in
We rattled down that highway to never come back again

Woody Guthrie,Dust Bowl Refugee,1940,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/dustbowlrefugee.html,"

I'm a dust bowl refugee
Just a dust bowl refugee
From that dust bowl to the peach bowl
Now that peach fuzz is a-killin' me

'Cross the mountains to the sea
Come the wife and kids and me
It's a hot old dusty highway
For a dust bowl refugee

Hard; it's always been that way
Here today and on our way
Down that mountain; 'cross the desert
Just a dust bowl refugee

We are ramblers; so they say
We are only here today
Then we travel with the seasons
We're the dust bowl refugees

From the south land and the drought land
Come the wife and kids and me
And this old world is a hard world
For a dust bowl refugee

Yes; we ramble and we roam
And the highway that's our home
It's a never-ending highway
For a dust bowl refugee

Yes; we wander and we work
In your crops and in your fruit
Like the whirlwinds on the desert
That's the dust bowl refugees

I'm a dust bowl refugee
I'm a dust bowl refugee
And I wonder will I always
Be a dust bowl refugee?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I been hearin' his name all over the land

Well; what is a vigilante man?
Tell me; what is a vigilante man?
Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?
Is that is a vigilante man?

Rainy night down in the engine house
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain
Was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days we passed the time away
Sleepin' in some good warm place
Man come along an' we give him a little race
Was that a vigilante man?

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man
And he said; ""Unite all you working men""
Killed him in the river some strange man
Was that a vigilante man?

Oh; why does a vigilante man
Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

I rambled 'round from town to town
I rambled 'round from town to town
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle
Was that the vigilante men?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've heard his name all over this land

Woody Guthrie,Pretty Boy Floyd,1940,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/prettyboyfloyd.html,"

If you'll gather 'round me; children
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd; an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
A Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Vulgar words of anger
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say

Well; you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Yes; as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

And as through your life you travel
Yes; as through your life you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home

Tom Joad got out of the old McAlester Pen
There he got his parole
After four long years on a man killing charge
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road; poor boy
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road

Tom Joad; he met a truck driving man
There he caught him a ride
He said; ""I just got loose from McAlester Pen
On a charge called homicide
A charge called homicide""

That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust
Tommy turned his face toward home
He met Preacher Casey; and they had a little drink
But they found that his family they was gone
He found that his family they was gone

He found his mother's old fashion shoe
Found his daddy's hat
And he found little Muley and Muley said
""They've been tractored out by the cats
They've been tractored out by the cats""

Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor's farm
Found his family
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car
And his mother said; ""We've got to get away""
His mother said; ""We've got to get away""

Now; the twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load
But Grandpa Joad did cry
He picked up a handful of land in his hand
Said; ""I'm stayin' with the farm till I die
Yes; I'm stayin' with the farm till I die""

They fed him short ribs and coffee and soothing syrup
And Grandpa Joad did die
They buried Grandpa Joad by the side of the road
Grandma on the California side
They buried Grandma on the California side

They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west
And it looked like the promised land
That bright green valley with a river running through
There was work for every single hand; they thought
There was work for every single hand

Lots of folks back East; they say; is leavin' home every day
Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line
'Cross the desert sands they roll; gettin' out of that old dust bowl

Now; the police at the port of entry say
""You're number fourteen thousand for today""

Why; you better go back to beautiful Texas; Oklahoma; Kansas; Georgia; Tennessee
California is a garden of Eden; a paradise to live in or see

You want to buy you a home or a farm; that can't deal nobody harm
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea
Don't swap your old cow for a car; you better stay right where you are
Better take this little tip from me

But the headlines on the papers always say

Woody Guthrie,Talking Dust Bowl Blues,1940,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/talkingdustbowlblues.html,"

Back in 1927
I had a little farm and I called that heaven
Well; the prices up and the rain come down
And I hauled my crops all into town
I got the money; bought clothes and groceries
Fed the kids; and raised a family

Rain quit and the wind got high
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine
And I poured it full of this gas-i-line
And I started; rockin' an' a-rollin'
Over the mountains; out towards the old Peach Bowl

Way up yonder on a mountain road
I had a hot motor and a heavy load
I's a-goin' pretty fast; there wasn't even stoppin'
A-bouncin' up and down; like popcorn poppin'
Had a breakdown; sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind
There was a feller there; a mechanic feller
Said it was en-gine trouble

Way up yonder on a mountain curve
It's way up yonder in the piney wood
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could
Commence coastin'; pickin' up speed
Was a hairpin turn; I didn't make it

Man alive; I'm a-tellin' you
The fiddles and the guitars really flew
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world
Scattered wives and childrens
All over the side of that mountain

We got out to the West Coast broke
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak
An' I bummed up a spud or two
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew
We poured the kids full of it
Mighty thin stew; though
You could read a magazine right through it
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but
Blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but
Bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun
Shining so bright
Never saw things
Going so right
Noticing the days
Hurrying by
When you're in love
My how the fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but
Blue skies
From now on

I got a big surprise; when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me. So...

Bye Bye Blues
Bye Bye Blues
Bells ring; birds sing
Sun is shining; no more pining
Just we two smiling through
Don't sigh; don't cry
Bye Bye Blues

The two of us together; just me and you
Will keep smilin'; smilin' through
So don't you sigh; and don't you cry
Bye Bye Blues

Dinah Washington,Am I Blue?,1954,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dinahwashington/amiblue.html,"

I'm just a woman; a lonely woman
Waiting on the weary shore
I'm just a woman who's only human
One you should feel sorry for

It was a morning; long before dawn
Without a warning I found he was gone
How could he do it; why should he do it
He never done it before

Am I blue; am I blue
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue
Why; wouldn't you be too
If each plan with your man
Done fell through

There was a time
When I was his only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one... lonely
Was I gay; until today
Now he's gone; and we're through
Am I blue

Together we're going; we're going a long; long way
In time the rockies may crumble; Gibraltar may tumble

A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down
I viewed the morning
With much alarm

It hadn't past
And suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

You know that we were meant to be more than just friends; just friends

Dinah Washington,Pennies From Heaven,1954,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dinahwashington/penniesfromheaven.html,"

A long time ago; about a million years B.C.
The best things in life were absolutely free

But no one appreciated a sky that was always blue
And no one anticipated a moon that was always new

So it was planned that they should vanish now and then
And you must pay before you get them back again

That's what storms were made for
And you shouldn't be afraid for

Every time it rains; it rains; pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Make sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love; you must have showers
So; when you hear it thunder; don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time it rains; it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Make sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love; you must have showers
So; when you hear it thunder; don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

So take a big deep breath of the clean fresh air
Put a smile on your face be a millionaire
The streets outside
Are paved with gold
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Love for sale
Appretizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale

Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I know every type of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love; new love
Every love but true love

Love for sale
Appretizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still; the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be
You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

You used to do

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

Little heart you've been broken many times before
But the wound always heals no matter how sore
But this time is different and I can't tell you why
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry

They say that time will erase all my sorrow
Well; I guess since I've lost you I'll find out tomorrow
Be gay while she's with you don't break down and cry
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry

A heart that is stricken with hate and with lies
Will soon be forsaken and left there to die
Well; I guess that's what happened she said her goodbye
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry...

Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would loose its touch

What would I be without you?
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart
You'd never leave me would you
You couldn't hurt me could you

Never let me go
Please never let me

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start all my bridges burned by my flaming heart
You'd never leave me would you
You couldn't hurt me could you?
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never... let me go...

What I saw the light that made me run myself to death

They're down the road about a mile they'll be here in a little while
There's company comin' up the road

Well; Granny change your apron and Willie shine your shoes
Sally put your new dress on we got no time to lose

They're comin' up the mountain side Susie don't you run and hide
There's company comin' up the road

We'll run out to the henhouse and wring a neck or two
We'll have chicken and dumplings and some yellow gravy too
Grandpa get your fiddle down they might want a tune
Everybody hurry cause them folks will be here soon

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money; I could do things my way?
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened; I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely; or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life has ended; my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave; there's no doubt
But this one thing's for certain; when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

Why the gods above me; who must be in the know

I can hear a lark somewhere; begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer; but how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

Old man sunshine; listen you
Never tell me dreams come true

Beatrice Fairfax; don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care

From any cheerful Polly Annas
Who tells you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky stars above but not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Ah; ho; alas and awe so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he never had eyes for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Ah ho alas and awe so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss

For one smiling day to be free

Behold how my lover loves me""

Instead of an answer; I laughed in his face

Two men that have won the highest of seats
Come; let me show you the world that you come through
It's a funny old world; as I'm sure you'll admit

If you wear rags on earth; you're a hobo
If you wear satin; they call you a thief
If you save money; they call you a miser
If you spend money; you are on relief

If you work hard; they say you are lowly
If you're a loafer; of course; you're no good
If you stay sober; you're known as a sissy
And if you drink liquor; it goes to your head

If you are fat; they will call you a glutton
If you stay skinny; they call you a runt
If you laugh; they'll call you an idiot
And if you cry; they will ask you to stop

If you chase women; they call you a wolfer
If you don't chase them; they call you afraid
If you chase men; they'll call you downtrodden
If you don't chase them; they'll call you old maid

If you eat your meat fried; they'll tell you to boil it
Then if you boil it; they'll say it should broil
If you don't eat meat; and eat only green things
They'll ask you what's wrong with the brain in your skull

If you work for wages; you support the rich capitalist
If you don't work; you're a lumpen to them
If you play the gamble; of course; you're a gambler
And if you don't gamble; you never do win

If you stay poor; nobody comes courting
And if you get rich; you can't find a mate
If you get married; you're wrecking your happiness
If you stay single; you walk to your grave

If you die in your cradle; it's a sad misfortune
If you live to old age; it's harder and worse
If you've read the papers; you know it is many
Who take their lives daily when they empty their purse

There's traders; and trappers; and shippers; and hopers
Sacco and Vanzetti; in America's fair lands
There's hoppers and croppers and robbers and dopers
And millions of folks with just two empty hands

You come the straight road; Sacco and Vanzetti
You fought with the lord on his most private ground
He hired his courts and his babblers against you
But; I'm here to say you went up and not down

And the great World's War we have won

Uncle Sammy has tied every nation in this world
In his long old leather money bags

Wilson caught a trip and a train into Paris
Meetin' Lloyd George and Mr. Clemenceau
They said to Mr. Wilson; ""We've staked all of our claims
There is nothing else for you""

""I plowed more lands; I built bigger fact'ries
An' I stopped Hindenburg in his tracks
You thank the Yanks by claimin' all the lands
But you still owe your money to my bank""

""Keep sending your ships across these waters
We'll borrow all the money you can lend
We must buy new clothes; new plows; and fact'ries
And we need golden dollars for to spend""

And it rolled into Uncle Sammy's door
A few got richer; and richer; and richer
But the poor folks kept but gettin' poor

Well; the workers in the world did fight a revolution
To chase out the gamblers from their land
Farmers; an' peasants; an' workers in the city
Fought together on their five-year plans

The soul and the spirit of the workers' revolution
Spread across ever' nation in this world
From Italy to China; to Europe and to India
An' the blood of the workers it did spill

This spirit split the wind to Boston; Massachusetts
With Coolidge on the Governor's chair
Troopers an' soldiers; the guards and the spies
Fought the workers that brought the spirit there

Sacco and Vanzetti had preached to the workers
They was carried up to Old Judge Thayer
They was charged with killin' the payroll guards
And they died in the Charlestown chair

Well; the world shook harder on the night they died
Than 'twas shaken by that great World War
More millions did march for Sacco and Vanzetti
Than did march for the great war lords

Well; the peasants; the farmers; the towns and the cities
An' the hills and the valleys they did ring
Hindenburg an' Wilson; an' Harding; Hoover; Coolidge
Never heard this many voices sing

The zigzag lightning; the rumbles of the thunder
And the singing of the clouds blowing by
The flood and the storm for Sacco and Vanzetti
Caused the rich man to pull his hair and cry

Well; once they had a dance they called the bunny-hop
Now the cats are in a trance; all they wanna do is bop
So bop; honey bop; well bop; a-honey bop
Oh bop; honey bop; well don't stop; a-honey bop
When the band begins to rock and it's rockin' to your blues
If you think you blow your top
Well; put on your rockin' shoes
And bop; honey bop; well bop; a-honey bop
Let's bop; honey bop; don't stop; a-honey bop

When the night is up and gone; but you still wanna go
Though you see light of dawn; baby tell the band to blow
And bop; honey bop; well bop; a-honey bop
Well bop; honey bop; don't stop; a-honey bop
Well the waltz is for the square and the rhumba is too old
Baby; we're just rockin' let it satisfy your soul
So bop; honey bop; well bop; a-honey bop
Oh bop; honey bop; well don't stop; a-honey bop

But the cats are in a trance; all they wanna do is bop

The nights made you lonely so you want to roam
You're no longer happy with me or your home
You search for excitement content used to grow

The gay crowd and the laughter have lured you away
Once you wanted be with you everywhere that you go
But you've turned to a stranger that I hardly know

I can't wash the pain from my tortured mind
With the gay crowd and the music and the bright light that shine
If this makes you happy I don't blame you if you go
You've turned to a stranger that I hardly know
The glamor of the night life can't lure me away
I'd rather sit waiting and long for the day
You'll return with your love that's faded so slow
No longer a stranger that I hardly know

Stranger beware; there's love in the air under Paris skies
Try to be smart and don't let your heart catch on fire
Love becomes king the moment it's Spring under Paris skies
Lonely hearts meet somewhere on the street of desire

Parisian love can bloom high in a skylight room
Or in a gay café where hundreds of people can see

I wasn't smart and I lost my heart under Paris skies
Don't ever be a heartbroken stranger like me

Oh; I fell in love
Yes; I was a fool
For Paris can be so beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette who wants to love and then forget
Stranger beware; there's love in the air

Just look and see what happened to me under Paris skies
Watch what you do; the same thing can happen to you

Ooh; I fell in love
Mmm; I was a fool

Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look

Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

So spread sunshine all over the place

In the dark; it's just you and I
There's not a sound and there's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart

Now; in the dark I get such a thrill
Well; well; when he places his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me; ""Please be still
In the dark""

But soon this dance will be ending
And you're gonna; you're gonna be missed
Gee; but I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear it's fun; it's fun to be kissed
In the dark; in the dark

Now we will find
Oh; what the rest; what the rest have left behind
Just let them dance 'cause we're gonna find romance
In the dark

The First Noel; the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel; Noel; Noel; Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel; Noel; Noel; Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel; Noel; Noel; Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel; Noel; Noel; Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Looked down the road; seen my Sally comin'
Thought to my soul I'd kill myself a runnin'

Goin' down the road and the road's mighty muddy
I'm so drunk that I can't stand steady

Watermelon; cantaloupe; peach tree puddin'
Ain't half as sweet as my little Sally Goodin

Stove lid's on; flap jacks a cookin'
Stack 'em up high for my pretty Sally Goodin

Kiss you all day and hug you all night
Me and my Sally gonna make it all right

Tell you stories and sing you songs
Marry me Sally and you can't go wrong

Possum up a gum stump; dog on the ground
Pull my trigger and a possum comes down

Bring you sody and bring you candy
Oh; my little Sally; won't that be dandy?

As we was watchin' the winding key
Sally got stung by a goggle eyed bee

It's every time you hold my hand
I walk over to the promised land

Sally come a kissin' me on my cheek
I jumped over the Buckeye Creek

What you gonna do when the wind starts a blowin'?
Run straight home with my petticoat a showin'

What you gonna do when the snow starts a flying?
Run home to mama just a squawling and crying

I'm not a lyin' an' I'm not a kiddin'
Crazy 'bout th' gal what you call Sally Goodin

It's the truth; I'll tell you well
If I can't have Sally; I'm bound for hell

Plants a kiss on the shore

And as we kiss through an embrace

I can tell; I can feel
You are love; you are real

Really mine
In the rain; in the dark; in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your arms

When I was a young man
Courting the girls
I played me the waiting game
If a girl refused me
With tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth
Take a couple of whirls

While I'd ply her with tears
In new of pearls
And as time came around
She came my way
And as time came around
She came

Oh; it's a long; long while
From May to December
But the days grow short
When you reach September
When the autumn weather
Turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time
For the waiting game

Oh; the days dwindle down
To precious few
September
November
And these few precious days
I'll spend with you
These precious days
I'll spend with you

As I brushed your heart and walked so close to you

At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

Let's go to church I'm on my way
Gonna lose my sorrow and every care

Now all I've got to wear in this old blue surge suit
And boy it looks like a real hand me down

Why I feel like I'm the Mayor of the town

Why I feel just like a new crowned King

The dash is dancing with gleaming dials

Scott Walker,Amsterdam,1967,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/amsterdam.html,"

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps
While the riverbank weeps with the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer; full of cries in a drunken down fight
And in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fishheads and tails
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can swallow the moon; that can haul up the sails
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
Bring me more fish put it down by my side
Then he wants so to belch but he's too full to try
So he gets up and laughs and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
Then out to the night with their pride in their pants
With the slut that they tow underneath the street lamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men
They've bargained their bodies and their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins; and when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds

But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore

What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget

Cause home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore

And that's makin' good kind of music by me
But you know my life is always changin' lines just to suit some melody
I'm hummin' all the time... you know I'm gonna be free

Every place I've ever been; I've just simply sung my thoughts

I makes money; money don't make me; that's the way I am and it's plain to see
Get right for yourself; they can't put you on a shelf
Live and let live; you know its plain enough
There ain't a dollar in the world can make me change my stuff

I met lots of men who told me when they finally make their first million
They're gonna live like kings; gonna try everything
They're gonna flatter pretty women
If they know how to do it; why not get to it; instead of waiting all your life
'Cause life is only doing; what you think is worth pursuing
Instead of waiting all the time

If you find yourself waiting and you know you're hesitating
Get your butt off the ground
It ain't your money or your honey; and you know it's kind of funny
When it's all boiled down
If you want to be the man; and you know you certainly can
Then do it; do it; do it; do it; do it
Clothes don't make the man; money won't help you stand
Any truer than you're doin'

So you'll never find the endin' of sittin' and pretending
You're gonna do it sometime
You keep knocking on wood; doing exactly what you should
Trying to save enough dimes

Build 'em up higher; so you can retire; to your castle in the blue
But you find it's all behind and it's probably slipped your mind
And you're too pooped to toot

In worn out shoes
Silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants

Then he'd lightly touch down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed slapped his leg a step

He said the name Bojangles and he danced
A lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants a better stance
Then he jumped so high
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh oh he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the South
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog
And him traveled about
His dog up and died

After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance in honky-tonks
For drinks and tips

Hell I drinks a bit

Spring was never waiting for us girl
It ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron like a strip-ed pair of pants.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again; oh no.

I recall the yellow cotton dress
foaming like a wave on the ground around your knees
And birds like tender babies in your hands
The old man playing checkers by the trees.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again; oh no.

[Instrumental]

There will be another song for me for and I will sing it
There will be another dream for me someone will bring it
I will taste the wine while it is warm
and never let you catch me looking in the sun
But after all the loves of my life
after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
And my passions flow like rivers from the sky
But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life
I'll still be along wondering why.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again; oh no...

Scott Walker,Funeral Tango,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/scottwalker/funeraltango.html,"

Oh I can see them now
Clutching a hankerchief
And blowing me a kiss
Discreetly asking how
How came he died so young
Or was he very old
Is the body still warm
Or is it already cold
All doors are open wide
They grope around inside
At my desk my drawers my trunk
There's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there
And an old photograph
They've laid my poor soul bare
And now all they do is laugh

Oh I can see them all
So formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant at arms
At a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing
To be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves
Like a ten cent valentine
The old women are there
Too old to give a damn
They've brought along the kids
Who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice
For now they'll have to pay

Oh I see all of you
All of my phoney friends
Who can't wait for it ends
Who can't wait till it's through
Oh I see all of you
You've been laughing all these years
Now all that you have left
Are a few crocodile tears
Ah you don't even know
That you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetary
You think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side
You're as proud as you can be
Ah she's going to make you cry
But not the way you cried for me

Oh I can see me now
So cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die
In my field of little bones
Oh I can see me now
I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I/m on
Without a love without a friend
Now all this that I see
Is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve
To say these things to me
No girls just bread and water
And your money you must save
For there'll be nothing left for us
When you're dead and in your grave

Andy Williams,Yesterday When I Was Young,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/andywilliams/yesterdaywheniwasyoung.html,"

Yesterday when I was young;
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue;
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game;
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed;
The splendid things I planned
I always built; alas;
on weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday; when I was young;
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung;
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see;

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out;
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me; and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue;
and every crazy day brought something new to do;
I used my magic age as if it were a wand;
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit too quickly; quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung;
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue;
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday
When I was Young.

Yesterday; when I was young;
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung;
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see;

Hank Williams Jr.,The Glass,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hankwilliamsjr/theglass.html,"

You walk in a tavern and you order yourself a drink
And wonder if she brings the glass
You try to imagine what kind of person had a drink from at last
Was he a rich man who stopped in on his way to make another big business deal
Or maybe just a poor man in old clothes who spent his last hard earned dollar bill
Was he dreamin' of his future or drawnin' his past or maybe just spendin' some time
A meetin' his sweetheart or somebody's wife
Or a barmaid he couldn't get off his mind
How many times did he refill the glass or just how long did he stay
And just how much money did he leave behind before he finally went on his way
Did he drink up the groceries or maybe the rent or even the baby's new pair of shoes
And what kind of music I wonder did he use to play
I'm sure his selection was the blues
This glass has been held in the hands of a hundred or so at one time
And been pressed to the lips of the fairest young girl
Who sat there sippin' on beer whiskey or wine
God just what would happened if this glass could talk and let the secret come true
I guess it's better that he'd never learned it might mean trouble for you

Oh; how I miss you; baby
Oh; how I miss you; baby
Listen to me

It's only been a week ago
But it seems like years
And it's getting sort of hard
To see through tears

'Cause now you're gone
And I know for myself
That I can't find happiness
With nobody else

Oh; how I miss you; baby
Oh; how I miss you; baby
Listen to me

I find myself calling out your name
In the middle of the night
And I still hear you saying; darling
No; no; two wrongs don't make it right

I thought I could cope it all alone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it didn't gain me one solitary thing
But an unhappy home

Oh; how I miss you; baby
Oh; how I miss you; baby

I wanna say sorry
Oh; but it ain't a strong enough word
For once in my life I'm so sincere
And I mean every word

I listen to what my friends had to say
But ooh; they messed me up again
'Cause I haven't seen a good day; baby
Since you know when

I never thought it could ever
Affect me this way
But I'm drownin' in a sea of misery
And all I can think of to say

Oh; how I miss you; baby
Oh; how I miss you; baby

I've got to keep on singing

He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea;
He alone decides who writes a symphony;
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright;
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night;
He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer;
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live;
He'll always say; ""I forgive.""
He can grant a wish or make a dream come true;
He can paint the clouds and turn to gray the blue;
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end;
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend;
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold;
He knows every lie that you and I have told.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we liv;
He'll always say; ""I forgive.""

The Angels of Ashes
Will give back your passions
Again and again

Their light shafts
Will reach through the darkness
And touch you my friend

They'll fly in a mind dance
And blind you with wings
Wrapped in flame

If you're down to an echo
They just might remember
Your name

In the unbroken darkness
Where emptiness empties
Alone

There's no starting or stopping
Where there is no right or
No wrong

Well that's all right for some
Who can hang the absurd
On their wall

If your blind hands can't grope
Through these measureless waters
You'll fall

You've been following patterns
And fleeting sensations
Too long

And the fullness that fills up
The pulse of durations
Is gone

Let the great constellation
Of flickering ashes
Be heard

Let them burn with a fire
All it takes to confess
Is a word; just a word

I can recommend angels
I've watched as they've made a man strong
Oh so strong

If your humbleness shows
Then I'm sure that they'll take you
Along

You can tell them who sent you
It might help to get you
Above

You can say that he laughed
And he walked like St. Francis
With love

My man can make my heart feel sad
He runs around and that makes me feel bad
And when he's at his fun he comes in with the rising sun
Looks at me; says; ""Honey don't be mad.""

But I'll take the bitter with sweet
And cherish the love I get each time we meet
'Cause when he holds me tight I tell him; ""Everything's all right.""
While my heart crumbles at his feet.

But Lord; please help me stop his urge to roam
Help me love him all I can 'cause love makes a home
There's something deep inside him I can't understand
But meanwhile he's still my man; meanwhile he's still my man.

There's something deep inside him
I can't understand
But meanwhile he's still my man and I love him
Meanwhile he's still my man...

Willie Nelson,Me And Paul,1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/meandpaul.html,"

It's been rough and rocky travelin';
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground.
And after takin' several readings;
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound.
I thought Nashville was the roughest;
But I know I said the same about them all.
We received our education 
In the cities of the nation; me and Paul.

Almost busted in Laredo;
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose;
But if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave;
Just don't leave nothin' in your clothes.
And at the airport in Milwaukee;
They refused to let us board the plane at all;
They said we looked suspicious;
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul. 

And on a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride.
The show was long and we was just sittin' there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride.
And we drank a lot of whiskey;
So I don't know if we went on that night at all.
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul.

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standin' upright on the ground.
And after takin' several readings;
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound.

Gary Wright,Love To Survive,1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/garywright/lovetosurvive.html,"

In the life I have seen more times
How indifferent people can be
With success they somehow conclude
That they're free from every need

But they see as time goes by
We need love to survive
We need love to survive

I have seen it a hundred times
Having had what money can bring
Sacrificing your precious years
You think you've found everything

But you'll see as time goes by
We need love to survive
We need love to survive
What a simple need

If we could only realize
All the truth and simplicity
Getting hung up on how to win
Is so far from reality

I have seen in my own time
We need love to survive
We need love to survive
Love is all we need

Strangers in many ways

So much to say
And as we go

But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
""I knew you well""
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know.

I see the shadows as they come to welcome the night
Treading the time when I know I must turn out the light
Here in the darkness I lie down to hurt once again
From letting a mem'ry who's heart sings a song of the wind
So much like a child yet so very much of a man
He was a drifter and I wasn't hard of his plan
He needed me when I met him so I took him in
Not knowing someday he'd follow a song of the wind
The wind sings the moving song of fields that'll always green
The man who has heard its call can't leave a thing unseen
If I should see him and he needs the warmth of a friend
I'll try to help him for the short time he was in
I won't be surprised when I wake and he's gone once again
For he is a dreamer who follows the song of the wind
Yes; he is a dreamer who's heart sings a song of the wind

Except a few old western suits she left scattered there on the patio
And they had mud all over 'em where she stomped around on 'em
Stepped on them wagon wheels; busted the spokes out
You know that real nice lavender suit?
One that she said I looked good in; looked like Tom Jones
That's it hanging over in that tree
She took that piece of chalk and wrote across the front of the coat
Have a good time; darling
You know; when you're hot; you're hot

Gonna drink a case of cold Coors
Hear old Merle Haggard sing
They had this antlered rabbit on the wall
Spiked horns and ears a foot tall
The bartender told me it was a Colorado jack lope

I been taken again; I've been taken again
It's like playing the blues
If your snoozing you lose
You'll be taken again

Well; later I took home; this old nymphomaniac
But I could not get her to lie upon her back
She told me something in my eyes had made her realize
That she could never do that lustful thing with me

If your snoozing you lose
You'll be taken again

Now people buy the records; think we're working so hard
We're out in the studios; and its five o'clock
They're hanging on every word; waiting on the very next verse
Think things are getting better from here
But I think they're getting worse

You gotta be saint on Sunday morning a devil on Saturday night
And when you love him do it right
Cause she's around at corner a wrapped in fur
And you've got to be just a little bit better than her
A little bit sweeter with morning kisses a whole lot warmer in the night
With a whole lotta good lovin' to make everything alright
Good lovin' keeps a home together...

Put your man right down the street and watch him go

On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by; watched them hold each other's hands
On their faces love had written ""we're making plans""

Then he said to her ""you're my guiding light""
Then she said to him ""you make my whole world seem so bright""
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be

Such tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light
They see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be?

Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said ""Jim and Jeannie; it's time to go""
With their hands still clutched so tight
Helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are?
Don't you know how close they must be?

Can we pretend
That from now on 
There is no yesterday
Paint a portrait of tomorrow
With no colors from today

There's a light that shine in your face sometimes
That takes my feeling wraps them around your need
But there's shadow hiding in your heart sometimes
That makes my feelings turn back in on me

Can we pretend
The pain is gone 
And go our merry way
Paint a portrait of tomorrow
With the colors bright and gay

I remember when the time was jive
What a groove it was to be alive
Take a beer in the back of a pink Cadillac
Watching all the girls go by

Just a-listened to the radio play
Had it turned up all the way
Singing ""one for the money; two for the show""
Three to get ready and away we go!

Take me back to those good old lazy days
When the guitars learned to talk and men were men
We were heart to heart; soul to soul
In the golden olden days of rock & roll

Yeah!

You could tell that we was hip at a glance
By the strips on down the side of your pants; yes
Nothing could be better than tights; girls and sweaters
Shakin' at the high school dance

Could it be so many years away?
You know it seems like only yesterday
We was rocking to the east; rocking to the west
Dancin' to the music; we all had a blast!

Take me back to those good old lazy days
When the guitars learned to talk and men were men
We were heart to heart; soul to soul

You've always had some kind of hold on me
There's one thing I know that's true if you want me I gotta want you

And it's the real thing kissing warm lips and tasting all your charms
Now there's the beating of your heart pressed close to mine

And two little arms around you neck so tight
But a poor half glass of whiskey gave a better lift
And the bottle by your pillow made your night

I thought that I could make a better man of you
But changes just don't happen overnight
You asked of us so many things we couldn't do
And you just never let that bottle out of sight

There's not a thing on earth that we can do to make you stay
But I know every time we touched the bottle
You hear my voice but see her face every single time
Every time you opened up the bottle

You hear my voice and see her face every single time

I guess things were always kind of quiet around Putnam County
Kind of shy and sleepy as it clung to the skirts of the two-lane
That was stretched out just like an asphalt dance floor
Where all the old-timers in bib jeans and store bought boots
Were hunkering down in the dirt
To lie about their lives and the places that they'd been
And they'd suck on Coca Colas; yeah; and be spitting Day's Work
Until the moon was a stray dog on the ridge and
And the taverns would be swollen until the naked eye of two a.m.
And the Stratocasters slung over the burgermeister beer guts
And swizzle-stick legs jackknifed over naugahyde stools... yeah
And the witch hazel spread out over the linoleum floors
And pedal-pushers stretched out over a midriff bulge
And the coiffed brunette curls over Maybelline eyes
Wearing Prince Machiavelli; or something yeah
Estee Lauder; smells so sweet
And I elbowed up at the counter with mixed feelings over mixed drinks
As Bubba and the Roadmasters moaned in pool hall concentration and
And knit their brows to cover the entire Hank Williams songbook
Whether you like it or not
And the old National register was singing to the tune of fifty-seven dollars and fifty-
seven cents yeah
And then it's last call; one more game of eight-ball
Berniece'd be putting the chairs on the tables
And someone come in and say; 'Hey man; anyone got any jumper cables?'
'Is that a 6 or a 12 volt; man? I don't know...'
Yeah; and all the studs in town would toss 'em down
And claim to fame as they stomped their feet
Yeah; boasting about being able to get more ass than a toilet seat
And the GMC's and the Straight-8 Fords were coughing and wheezing
And they percolated as they tossed the gravel underneath the fenders
To weave home a wet slick anaconda of a two-lane
With tire irons and crowbars a-rattling
With a tool box and a pony saddle
You're grinding gears and you're shifting into first
Yeah; and that goddamned tranny's just getting worse; man
With the melody of see-ya-laters and screwdrivers on carburetors
Talking shop about money to loan
And palominos and strawberry roans yeah
See ya tomorrow; hello to the Missus
With money to borrow and goodnight kisses
As the radio spit out Charlie Rich; man;
He sure can sing that son of a bitch
And you weave home; yeah; weaving home
Leaving the little joint winking in the dark warm narcotic American night
Beneath a pin cushion sky
And it's home to toast and honey; gotta start up the Ford; man
Yeah; and your lunch money's right over there on the draining board
And the toilet's running Christ; shake the handle
And the telephone is ringing; it's Mrs. Randall
And where the hell are my goddamned sandals?
What you mean; the dog chewed up my left foot?
With the porcelain poodles and the glass swans
Staring down from the knickknack shelf. yeah
And the parent's permission slips for the kids' field trips
Yeah; and a pair of mukluks scraping across the shag carpet yeah
And the impending squint of first light
And it lurked behind a weeping marquee in downtown Putnam

To read about who's livin' her life

He fires up his pickup he just got off the graveyard
And he trudges down the road home to another
Cause life's so dang dead in the house where he's been dyin'
He wonders why the heck he even bothers

So he stops off at a water hole and picks up a pint
The most perfect peace of mind two bucks can buy
Now he's takin' his life home in a brown paper bag
Instead of just takin' his lie

He's sittin' there in his undershirt just guzzlin' down his gin
She'd lied on her satin sheets lovin' her leading men
And neither one of them can look the other in the eyes
And now the two brown paper bags are just two garbage cans that used to hold their lives
And now all the riches that they shared have turned to rags

He just goes from town to town; stirring up the young folks
'Til they're nothing but a disrespectful mob

I know for sure He's never joined the army
And served His country like we all have done
He'd rather wear His sandals and His flowers
While others wage the war that must be won

And sentenced Him to die but that's no great loss

And hang that troublemaker to a cross

Willie Nelson,Precious Memories,1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/preciousmemories.html,"

Precious memories; unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger; ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold.

Precious memories; how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious; sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father; loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing; gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere.

I remember mother praying
Father; too; on bended knee
Sun is sinking; shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me.

As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder; hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul.

Tom Waits,Bad Liver And A Broken Heart (In Lowell),1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/badliverandabrokenheartinlowell.html,"

Well I got a bad liver and broken heart; yeah;
I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
And I don't have a drinking problem; 'cept when I can't get a drink
And I wish you'd a-known her; we were quite a pair;
She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer
So welcome to the continuing saga; she was my better half; and I was just a dog
And so here am I slumped; I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool
So buy this fool some spirits and libations; it's these railroad station bars
And all these conductors and porters; and I'm all out of quarters
And this epitaph is the aftermath; yeah I choose my path; hey; come on; Kath;
He's a lawyer; he ain't the one for ya
No; the moon ain't romantic; it's intimidating as hell;
And some guy's trying to sell me a watch
And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream; it's so maudlin it seems;
You can name your poison; go on ahead and make some noise
I ain't sentimental; this ain't a purchase; it's a rental; and it's purgatory;
And hey; what's your story; well I don't even care
'Cause I got my own double-cross to bear

And I'll see your Red Label; and I'll raise you one more;
And you can pour me a cab; I just can't drink no more;
'Cause it don't douse the flames that are started by dames;
It ain't like asbestos
It don't do nothing but rest us assured;
And substantiate the rumors that you've heard

Later on; the story goes;
A bottle floated out to sea.
After days; when it had found the perfect spot;
it opened up;
And I read the note that you never wrote to me

After all; I'm sure you know;
The Mayor of Baltimore is here.
After days now he can finally appear;
Now at last he's here;

But he never is gonna get my vote;
'cause he never is gonna get a quote
from the little note
that you never wrote to me.

Further on; along the line;
I was arrested on the shore;
Holding papers of governments galore.
I was taken in;

But I read the note that you never wrote.
Yes; I read the note that you never wrote.
Oh; I read the note that you never wrote to me.

And the sun shines wherever you are
And I must say that I don't blame the sun
It's a good day wherever you are
And a good night when the day is done

There was a foxy little lady dancing down in the front row
I said; ""Honey; can you meet me when I finish the next show?""
There was somethin' about the lady that really got to me
She was down on my zipper; tears a-ripplin' through me
She said; ""Boy; let me tell you if you're gonna give me good love
Start makin' good love; it's what you really got plenty of""

She told me now; ""Don't go near the water; yeah
If you can't swim the tide""
She told me now; ""Don't go near the water; yeah
If you can't swim the tide""

Well; let me tell you; couldn't wait 'til the last song was over
I had sixty-nine ways I was really gonna show her
So I took her to the dressing room and really got to it
Everything I thought I'd show her; well; she already knew it
But I looked at my watch; it was time for me to go
I said; ""Honey; got to stop or I'll be late for the next show""
She said; ""There ain't no way I got to stop this good thing
If you're gonna be a man; you got to finish what you started""

I'll trade some of these travelin' blues for some Tennessee Sunshine

And I tried rodeo'in last fall

And travelled Canada east of Montreal

Vibrations you're making are setting my soul on fire

Just say the word; that I'll come running to you
If you feel like I feel baby
Come on the band is right; don't fight it

But that lucky old sun 
Ain't got nothing to do 
But roll around heaven all day 

Lord above 
can't you see I'm cryin' 
Tears are in my eyes 
Send down a cloud 
With a silver linin' 
Take me to paradise 

Show me that river 
lead me across 
Take all my troubles away 
Like that lucky old sun 
I'll have nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day - 
An' Like that lucky old sun

Willie Nelson,Me And Bobby Mcgee,1979,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/meandbobbymcgee.html,"

Busted flat in Baton Rouge headed for the trains feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
And with the windshield whipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
And body that was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee
[guitar]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Looking for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word...

I need love
I need life
I need to know that
That I have someone that I can love
Baby; you're the one
The one I need

Can you make me feel the way I think you can
And girl; can you make me realize how good it is to be a man

Can you take the cold nights and make them seem so warm
Can you unfold mysteries and thrill me with all your charm

You're the one; you're the one I need
You're the one; you're the one I need
Girl; you're the on; you're the one I need
Girl; you're the on; you're the one I need

Is it possible for you to see the mistake I've surely made
Give me an accept for each one so I can make the grade

Girl can you see it's love I need
Can you see these things
And if you could; would you tell me

You're the one; you're the one I need
Girl; you're the on; you're the one I need

How many times
Have you heard someone say
If I had his money
I'd do things my way
How little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in a hundred
With a satisfied mind

Once I was living
In fortune and fame
And everthing I could dream of
To get a start in life's game
And suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind

No money can buy back
Your youth when your old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
And the world's richest man
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life is over
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

Sometimes we got to catch him before he's walking out the door

We will realize our love that we have

Love is a cold wind
When it blows away from you
As you watch it go
It hurts to know
There's nothing you can do
You're all alone again
And love is a cold wind

Love is a rain storm
But it only rains on you
And there's no one there
Who seems to care
No one to pull you through
And inside you're never warm
Cause love is a rain storm

But when she was here
Love was a breezy morning
Filled with the sun
Warm as her smile
But now it's done

Love is a cold wind
As it blows away from you
So you find your way
To yesterday
What else is left to do
You're all alone again
And love is a cold wind

But when she was here
Love was a breezy morning
Filled with the sun
Warm as her smile
But now it's done

And love is a cold wind
As it blows away from you

What else is there to do
You're all alone again

Demand so little of you.

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
Even had me singin' along right with you you said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
Sang the song you had written for me to someone new.

Nobody sings love songs quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel the things are right
When I know they're wrong
Nobody sings love songs quite like you.

Sing your song sweet music man
Travel the world with a six piece band that does for you
What you ask me to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you.

Sing your song sad music man
Makin' your living doing one night stands
They're through with you they don't need you
You're still a hell of a singer but a broken man.

But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel the things are right

Nobody sings a love song quite like you.

Just hang on to the band
You can dance while your knowledge is growing

And her high heels clicking on the floor

'Fore you even know it; we were tighter than old Jimmy J's pants
Ain't nothing to learn; one slide or a turn
With a big move over to the side
Where we don't have to shout; and we can both figure out

But you cant never never let the game close in on you
OH

Moves 
to stay ahead
Well; I'm sick and tired of them yessin' me 
just for my bread
I know y'all heard what I said

just like they play your favourite song
They play it over and over and over again 'til the grooves are gone

Time oh

It has a story; story; story; story.
and how you play the game
Cant you see that its all up to you
nobody but you
you gotta make your moves 
make your moves whilst you still can win em 
still got a chance brother
But you cant never let the moves close in 
close in on you
Woooo!

Games;
Well;
I'm talking about those games that people play
(the games people play; well)
I said to myself; I said self;
What a way; what a way 
to pass the time of day

Oh girl have just you to let you down
Fallin in and out of love

The Who,Cache Cache,1981,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/who/cachecache.html,"

Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
With apple cores and mice along
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Or search for a place where the wind was gone

Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cosy homes with secret beds
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread

Well I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratchin mice
Although you'll find some deep brown hair
I'll tell you something for nothing
There ain't no bears in there (cache cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache cache)

Did you ever have to make a draw
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone
Did you ever jemmy a stable door
Or scare the horse to escape the snow

Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the children who hope for ghosts
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark
Their guests to curse their noisy hosts

Don't jump in expectin fun
Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun
Don't enter the cage with wavin chairs
Cos I'll tell you something for nothing
There ain't no bears in there (cache cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache cache)

Did you ever pass the police at work
And hope that they might take you in
Did you ever wonder why music hurts
When someone plays it aloof to sin
Did you ever believe that a smile could cure
A happy face keep you warm at night?
Were you ever fooled by laughters lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite?

[Chorus: (as above)]

Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours
A hundred hours.

There ain't no bears in there (cache cache)

And you make my love perspire

Come here
Let's talk dear
There are things inside me
I want you to hear

I want to soak into you like rain
Make love until my energy drains
And as lust erases all shame
You'll scream my name out of pleasure; not pain

If you just say yes

I will do the rest

Come here
This is your hour
Ooh; like raindrops on a flower
Come bathe in my love shower

Then let me blow your body dry
Kiss the tears from your sexy eyes
And as our passion begins to rise
We'll lay hypnotized by the pleasure inside

If you just say yes
(Girl; if you would only say yes)
Please say yes; I'll do the rest
(I'll do the rest)

Oh; I want to build you a dream home
Made of love; not just wood and stone
Give you the deed to all that I own
Give you love beyond limit
Give you babies in our image

Please say yes; I'll do the rest

Have you ever been kissed from head to toe
Down your back; around your navel
Well; you got that comin'; my sweet
And even more tricks and treats
I'm willing and I'm able

Because I love you
Really; really love you
And I'm so damn proud of you; baby

I bring it up 
You're quick to cover it all up again 
Thought we were friends 
What are friends for? 
The old bones in your closet 
Must really embarrass you 
And so to save face 
It's a locked place 

[Chorus:]
I don't see why you don't get naked with me 
Get all the little secrets out in the open air 
'Cause we won't ever be 
All that we could be 

As long as you won't get naked with me 
The future's gettin' shaky 
From all this holdin' back 
There's something in your past 

That seems to haunt you 
For better or for worse; I said 
I meant it through and through 
No one has ever loved you 
More than I do

If she's there when the memories
Walk around
Maybe someday

As much as I love you

I plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
and a Black Crow snuck through
a hole in the sky
so I spent all my buttons on an
old pack mule
and I made me a ladder from
a pawn shop marimba
and I leaned it up against
a dandelion tree

And I filled me a sachel
full of old pig corn
and I beat me a billy
from an old French horn
and I kicked that mule
to the top of the tree
and I blew me a hole
'bout the size of a kickdrum
and I cut me a switch
from a long branch elbow

[Chorus]
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six

Well I slept in the holler
of a dry creek bed
and I tore out the buckets
from a red Corvette; tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three
you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
with the strings of a Washburn
stretched like a clothes line
you know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole

[Repeat Chorus]

Now I hold him prisoner
in a Washburn jail
that stapped on the back
of my old kick mule
strapped it on the back of my old kick mule
I bang on the strings just
to drive him crazy
I strum it loud just to rattle his cage
strum it loud just to rattle his cage

There's no way that you can lose;
My chassis fits like a glove;
I've got a button for love;
That you have got-to-use.
If you look into my file;
I am sure you can find out how;
To turn me on just set my dial;
And let me love you for a little while - ooh

Constantly reminding me how much you used to care
And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret

Who am I to believe in love;
Oh; love ain't no stranger

Broken hearted people staring at me;
All searching 'cos they still believe;
Oh; love ain't no stranger

I was alone an' I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of;
I heard no warning; but; a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

Love ain't no stranger;

With something always missing

Will be filled with passion; love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfaction’s guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be

Fill me with your kisses

For the one worth giving / Love sky high
And I don't have to think twice / Flying high

When everyone goes home
And I'm left standing here

When shadows paint the scene
Where spotlights used to fall
And now it's like a dream
Did it happen after all?

Then I see you there
In silent silhouette
The glow of your cigarette
Is like a shooting star

Lady of my heart
Tell me who you are
You've waited in the dark
And I need you will be with me tonight

Lady; please reveal
If what you are is real
Can I touch? Can I feel?
Just an image of you

I've listened to the cheers
I guess I've heard my share
But I was never sure
Was it you out there?

Now I understand
You've always been the one
Who stood out from the crowd
You're my inspiration

So take me by the hand
Before the moment's gone
I'll dance you into the dawn
And dream you into my life

I'm sittin' in Knoxville courthouse ain't got a thing to do
I don't wanna go to the movies couldn't if I wanted to cuz I'm on trial for lovin' you
Now this all started in a honky tonk just the other side of town
A girl come in took a stool by me ordered gin and drank it down
She lit up a cigarette sexly turned around
Well she said my name is Jannie and asked me what was mine
I answered Hank as I walked to the jukebox droppin' a dime
checked out her short dress low neck line
Well we danced for five or ten minutes and I held her close to me
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips and judged about twenty three
Whispered in my ears I said yes siree
Now the scene is a little motel out on the state highway
There in room 12 little love is about to take place
And a state trooper breaks down the door shines a flash light in my face
I said what the hell is this and another man and woman come in
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin' and she runs over to them
Said thank God you're here he tried to hurt me mama
I said now you don't mean the cop says son the girl is seventeen
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse and the judge passed sentence on me
And it's ten long years for statutory rape in the state penitentiary
Lord I can't believe this is happened to me
So when next time you give a girl the eye she gives you that certain smile
Just remember under that woman's breast may beat the heart of a child
Don't you let yourself be the one to help a mixed up kids go wild
This story happened a lot that's true
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you

From the new born babe in your arms
Was a pealing of thunder; a cannonball flying
A sun exploding; Dawn in the heart of me

Tom Waits,Rain Dogs,1985,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomwaits/raindogs.html,"

Inside a broken clock
Splashing the wine
With all the rain dogs
Taxi; we'd rather walk
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog; too

Oh; how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh; how we danced away
All of the lights
We've always been out of our minds

The rum pours strong and thin
Beat out the dustman
With the rain dogs
Aboard a shipwreck train
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog too

Oh; how we danced with the
Rose of Tralee
Her long hair black as a raven
Oh; how we danced and you
Whispered to me
You'll never be going back home
You'll never be going back home

Oh; how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh; how we danced away
All of the lights
We've always been out of our minds

Loudon Wainwright III,Career Moves,1985,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loudonwainwrightiii/careermoves.html,"

For 20 odd years I have strummed on guitars
5;000 lost flat picks; four fingertip scars
I must have broken a million g strings
Picking and strumming; and playing these things
Banging and tunin'; and playing these things

And it's been 16 years now that I've written songs
Over a 100 and still growing strong
About drinking and hockey and flying above
Again and again about unhappy love
Over and over; unhappy love

And it's music for money; but I'll do it for fun
Oh; I know how to do it; it's easily done
To stand on a stage doesn't make me afraid
I'm comfortable up there; it's gotten me laid
It always amazes me when I get paid

So here am I doing all that I can do
You're paying; I'm playing; I'm grateful to you
Indoors and outdoors; at home and abroad
I sing these songs and you people applaud
You haven't changed much; you still applaud

I've been around
I used to sing songs that were hand-me-downs
I've been called a hero 
I've been called a clown
I've learned the old ways and the new ways now

I've been around
I can drop names that will knock ya down
I've rock and rolled and I've fiddled around
From Hollywood to the Nashville sound

I've been around
Climbed the highest mountain I found
I went to the top and I fell back down
And I know what I'm talking about
'Cause I've been around

I've been in love
I've been down on my knees and prayed to God above
""Why does so much pain go with so mich love?
Why is she still the one I'm dreaming of?""

Yeah; I've been around
And the best two friends I've ever found 
Are a woman's love and a guitar sound

Last night; I had a long talk with myself

Yes; in case if you wanna know what I'm talkin' about
Last night; I finally had to have it out
I sat down with myself; to set myself straight
'Cause this is one problem that couldn't wait
I tried to be cool; but things have gone too far
I said to myself ""Who do you think you are?""
Then a voice answered back that sounded just like mine
And to top that off; it also rhymed
It said ""This is your conscious; this is your pride
This is all the things you've been trying to hide
You can run and hide; from everyone else
But you see you can't hide; from yourself""
So take my advice; and give it some thought
You better change your ways; 'cause life's too short
So tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you wanna know the deal; I'll tell you why

Last night; I had a long talk with myself
Last night; I had a long talk with myself
Last night; I had a long talk with myself

What you said last night; it wasn't very nice
But I sat back; and thought about it twice
But believe it or not; girl; you was right
So I decided; to take your advice
I mean after all; you are my girl
You're the last thing I want to loose in this world
I was so wrapped up in my own little game
If I ever lost you; I would be the blame
You was there to share; what I lost and found
You knew it when I blew it; when I messed around
You was there through thick; and you'll be there through thin
You was there from the start; so be there in the end
That's why I itch no one or bug it
And if you never went erase; I will always love you
And tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you want to know the deal; I'll tell you why

Last night; I had a long talk with myself
Last night; I had a long talk with myself
Last night; I had a long talk with myself

Last night; I had a long talk with myself

Last night; just about this time
I bumped into a good friend of mine
And to see him again; was a pleasant surprise
Together again; rockin' side by side
And as we spoke and joke; he started to complain
Talkin' about he noticed how much I'd changed
Slowly but surely; as he said what he thought of me
Believe it or not; my eyes got watery
He talked about a plan he made up today
Talk about me and him rockin' all the way
Right to the top; and I mean non-stop
To be the first and the best to make it off our block
The sky's the limit; together to the finish
You got to be in it; in order to win it
So tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you wanna know the deal; I'll tell you why

Last night; I had a long talk with myself...

Willie Nelson,Pass It On,1986,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/passiton.html,"

I can see indifference is the sign of the times
Seems to me compassion's gettin' harder to find
But if everyone would help just one and that one helps another one along
Like a fire that's burning low every log would make it grow; so pass it on

Pass it on to a brother who may need a helping hand
Pass it on to a sister it may give her strength to stand
Love and kindness make a flame known by many different names
So pass it on; pass it on; pass it on

People say I'd like to help but I can't get involved
And anyway I've got problems of my own I haven't solved
Someday when we learn that no-one's strong enough to make it on their own
I just hope there's someone there who will take the time to care and pass it on

Pass it on to a brother who may need a helping hand
Pass it on to a sister it may give her strength to stand
Love and kindness make a flame known by many different names
So pass it on; pass it on; pass it on
Pass it on; pass it on; pass it on

Each night I fluff your pillow up beside me
Lay out your favorite gown all trimmed with lace
It may not cross your mind to wonder how things are without you
But if it ever does I saved your place

I hold on to how you used to touch me
When I close my eyes I see your face
It breaks my heart that someone else could make you feel more wanted
But if he lets you down I saved your place

There may come a time when this is all just some old memory
But time's not movin' very fast these days
With all you've got you may not need a fool who really loves you
But if you ever do I saved your place

When he's holding you; you may not need a fool who really loves you
But if you ever do I saved your place

In unlit alleyways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays
Come down sometime
We'll share a rusty can of corn...
And listen to the radio
I love you; I love you; it says...

[CHORUS:]
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico

You cry; but I don't know
I've heard it all before
There it goes again; the slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says ""put your troubles down beside me""
Things have always been the same...
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me
What the river said that night
I jumped into this beauty
And drifted out of sight...

She was a flower for the takin'; 
Her beauty cut just like a knife...
He was a banker from Macon; 
Swore he'd love her all his life...

Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land...

But paradise became her prison;
That Georgia banker was a jealous man!

Every time he'd talk about her;
You could see the fire in his eyes...
He'd say;
""I would walk through Hell on Sunday; 
To keep my Rose in Paradise...""

He hired a man to tend the garden; 
Keep an eye on her while he was gone..
Some say they ran away together... 
Some say that gardner left alone...

Now the banker is an old man... 
That mansion's cum-ble-ing down...
He sits all day and stares at the garden... 
Not a trace of her was ever found...

Every time he talks about her; 
You can see the fire in his eyes...
He'd say; ""I would walk through Hell on Sunday; 
To keep my Rose in Paradise..""

Now there's a rose out in the garden... 
Its beauty cuts just like a knife...
They say that it even grows in the winter time... 
And blooms in the dead of the night...

So still together when we're apart
I begin to die unless you're here

Can't keep holding on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say...

[Chorus:]
Girl I'm hungry; for your love
Girl I'm hungry; baby let me in
Hungry; for your love
Hungry; I can't get enough

I lie awake all night
Can't stop remembering
You've got to make it right
I can't hold it in

[Solo]

HUNGRY!!!!

I hear the ticking on the clock
Counting everyday I've been alone...
Hungry

[Chorus:]
I'm hungry; for your love
Girl I'm hungry; I can't get enough
Hungry; for your skin
Hungry; baby let me in
Hungry; for your love
Hungry!!!
I'm hungry; for your love
Hungry... Oh no!!!!
Hungry!!!!

A high road; low road; some old side road
Really don't matter to me it gets me back to you
Jet plane; fast train; bus in a hard rain; any ol' way you please
If it gets me back to you

Young man; big shot; gotta see what's out there
Leave town; hung around; what the hell does he care
Corner park; broken heart; girl in her home town
Porch light every night; hoping that he comes around

A high road; low road; some old side road
Really don't matter to me if it gets me back to you
Hitchhike; motor bike; any ol' way you like; crawling on my knees
If it gets me back to you

Somewhere out there the world's on his shoulder
Each night the same stuff the world's getting colder
Dreams die slow as a boy becomes a man
High road; low road; any way he can

A high road; low road; some old side road
Really don't matter to me 
If it gets me back to you
Jet plane; fast train; bus in a hard rain; any ol' way you please
If it gets me back to you

Hitchhike motor bike; any ol' way you like; crawling on my knees
If it gets meeeeee

Oh; a high road low road; some old side road
Really don't matter to me 
If it gets me back to you
Jet plane; fast train; bus in a hard rain; any ol' way you please
If it get me back to you

A high road low road; some old side road
A high road low road; some old side road

Steve Winwood,One More Morning,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevewinwood/onemoremorning.html,"

In the sky; light is coming; so glad we all have this day
We all want one more morning just to know the night won't stay
Lift my eyes to the dawning to see the life start again
Just to see one more morning; just to feel it all begin
Just to have this day and life starting all over; for all it may bring

A blessing on everything and one more song I can sing

One more day; one more memory; one more link in the chain
We all want one more morning just to feel it all again
Just to have this day and life starting all over; for all it may bring

A blessing on everything and one more song I can sing
In the arms we were born in; in the arms that will take us home
We all want one more morning; then we'll take the night to come

Wire,Pieta,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wire/pieta.html,"

Doubting Thomas parks his car in his Sunday best
Taps his wallet; straightens tie; lights a cigarette

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

Through the door he scans the bar; then a space appears
His drink is poured; for he is numb; the service it starts here

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

He sees it in the barmaid's face; a winning smile's caress
A million eyes in public stalk; the queue up to confess

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

Lost causes; loves; hates and shames; old battles fought and won
Bad debts; bad tips; the graveyard song; the dreamers talk in tongues

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

Haloes swarm; the air is thin; thick smoke in tights of blue
Elvis has a wooden heart; eyes dart across the room

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

Empty heads and stomachs full; the ashtrays overflow
Drinks are raised and voices praise good deeds of long ago

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

He drains his glass and makes a sign; the Virgin Queen appears
The Prince King needs a tender touch; his sacred heart knows no fear

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

Upon a cloud on optic shrine; he can't control his tears
On his knees; hands held in prayer; a practice lapsed for years

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

The altar clears; the light grows dim; the sanctus bell is rung
A miracle at closing time; our lady holds her son

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end

The faithful come to celebrate the vision Thomas saw
A rail now stands around the spot where Thomas... kissed the floor

Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress; no journey's end
Which way Michael?

I'm out the back door just before midnight
I push the pedal to the floor---I run away
She says it's only in my head
But my heart is screaming

Hey you!! What you trying to prove
I won't play your game and
I won't play your fool
Hey you!! Best be makin' your move
Play your last hand
Better understand

[Chorus:]
Now it's time to surrender; yeah!!
Cause my love don't live here anymore
Oooo babe; time to surrender
There's nothing left to fight for
There's nothing left to save

Oh! she cries so tough
It's too hard to let go of
The lies inside the shadow
Of her tears and of her pain
And I denied when she was
Playing the heartbreaker

Hey you!! What you trying to prove
I won't play your game and
I won't play your fool
Hey you!! Best be makin' your move
Play you last hand
Better understand

[Chorus:]
Now it's time to surrender; yeah!!
Cause my love don't live here anymore
Time to surrender
It's not love your making
It's my heart you're breaking

Oh no!! I can't take this again
Night after night;
Just pretending
Oh no!! It's closer to the end
My body says go;
But I know that

Now it's time to surrender; yeah!!
Cause my love don't live here anymore
Time to surrender
There's nothing left to fight for
There's nothing left to save

Time to surrender; yeah!!
Cause my love don't live here anymore
Time to surrender
It's not love your making
It's my heart you're breaking

Surrender!!

Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange

That place where the bones of life are piled

I know I keep you amused

Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none; in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's a pain I could do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
You turned into a lover and mother what a lover
You wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Find myself a rock and roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first class fool out of me
Now I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

And the oldest friend I've got I met today
The woman that I love just up and left me
And the place I love's a thousand miles away.

Operator hook me up to Houston
Get me anybody on the phone
Look there in your book and pick a number
Cause you can't be choosy when you're this alone

Won't you talk to me Texas?
Let me hear that drawl
I spent my last five dollars on this one long distance call
Wont you talk to me Texas
I've got these homesick blues
Tell me I can come on home to you

I've got this faded number in my wallet
It's been here a dozen years I know
I used to call it up when I was lonely
Oh that woman sure could love me so

I know by now she's probably changed her number
And with my luck she's probably changed her name
If there's a chance in hell ill think ill take it
Cause Id love to hear that woman's voice again

Won't you talk to me Texas?
Let me hear that drawl
I spent my last five dollars on this one long distance call
Wont you talk to me Texas

And I love; and I love; and I love when it's ragin'

Yes you're shy; you're not a talkative guy
But I know just what you feel (said I know what you feel)
Cuz what you don't say; I hear anyway
Body language is the real deal

And when we're alone; ah; at home
The half ain't never been told
You take your time; you don't rush
And your gentle touch
Sets a fire in my soul

Your love is a quiet storm
And I love when it's ragin'
Your love is a quiet storm
And I love; and I love; and I love when it's ragin'

Quiet people are often misunderstood
Some take their meekness for weakness
But you've got special appeal
You give me such a thrill
Who cares if you speak less?

People looking from the outside they
Never seem to see
That that quiet man
With one touch of his hand
Can bring the beast out in me
In me

Your love is a quiet storm
And I love when it's ragin'; ragin'
Your love is a quiet storm
And I love; and I love; and I love when it's ragin'
When it's ragin'; when it's ragin'

These quiet men they just seem to ring my bell
You know girls prefer quiet men cuz they don't kiss and tell
And maybe I love quiet men cuz I love to talk
And if he's a good listener
Mmm; he'll get all kinds of things outta me like
I could mow his lawn; I'll wash his car whatever he wants
He got it

Your love is a quiet storm
And I love when it's ragin'
Your love is a quiet storm
And I love; and I love; and I love when it's ragin'

Quiet or not; baby whatever you got
You get the best out of me; yeah
I like what you does
And before this song is through I wanna be
Making sweet love to you

Mother 's first look to the eyes of a child
Casts the die of destiny.
It's a perfect life she gives to you;
Not to lose so innocently.
Leading the way; she rises above
Unexpected adversity.

The words of warning; thunder in the night.
I hear her calling; guarding what is right.
I see her waiting; Keeper of the Light. 

A silhouette on the skyline; a symbol of your liberty;
Protecting time that's passing by;
Mother knows; never lies.
A better life the children will see;
A world of change; full of hope and sympathy.

The words of warning; thunder in the night.

I've had enough got to get away
It's about that time / got to get away

Get a little closer to a fast car
Get away from the grind / it's about that time

Every damn day we're under pressure
About to lose it lose my mind

I need to loosen up / loosen up
I need a little juicin up
I've been hangin from the noose
Baby won't you cut me loose
Come on everybody loosen up

I need it fast I'm in need of the buzz
When we're all together / I'm in need of the buzz

Like a time bomb I'm about to explode
We've got to come together / before I blow

I'm spendin too many days under pressure
About to lose it lose my mind

I need to loosen up / loosen up
I need a little juicin up
I've been hangin from the noose

Woody Guthrie,Buffalo Skinners,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/woodyguthrie/buffaloskinners.html,"

Come all you jolly skinners; and listen to my song
There are not many verses; it will not detain you long
It's concerning some young fellows who did agree to go
And spend one summer pleasantly of the range of the buffalo

'Twas in the town of Jacksboro in the spring of Sev'nty three
A man by the name of Crego came stepping up to me
Saying; ""How do you do; young fellow; and how would you like to go
And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo?""

""It's me being out of employment; this to Crego I did say
""This going out on the buffalo range depends upon the pay
But if you will pay good wages and transportation; too
I think; sir; I will go with you to the range of the buffalo""

""Yes; I will pay good wages; give transportation; too
Provided you will go with me and stay the summer through
But if you should grow homesick; come back to Jackboro
I won't pay transportation from the range of the buffalo""

It's now our outfit was complete - seven able-bodied men
With navy six and needle gun - our troubles did begin
Our way it was a pleasant one; the route we had to go
Until we crossed Pease River on the range of the buffalo

It's now we've crossed Pease River; our troubles have begun
The first dam tail I went to rip; Christ! How I cut my thumb
While skinning the dam old stinkers our lives they had no show
For the Indians watched to pick us off while skinning the buffalo

He fed us on such sorry chuck I wished myself most dead
It was old jerked beef; croton coffee and sour bread
Pease River's as salty as hell fire; the water I could never go
O God! I wished I had never come to the range of the buffalo

Our meat it was buffalo hump and iron wedge bread
And all we had to sleep on was a buffalo robe for a bed
The fleas and graybacks worked on us; O boys; it was not slow
I'll tell you there's no worse hell on earth than the range of the buffalo

Our hearts were cased with buffalo hocks; our souls were cased with steel
And the hardships of that summer would nearly make us reel
While skinning the damned old stinkers our lives they had no show
For the Indians waited to pick us off on the Hills of Mexico

The season being near over; old Grego he did say
The crowd had been extravagant; was in debt to him that day
We coaxed him and we begged him and still it was no go
We left old Crego's bones to bleach on the range of the buffalo

Oh; it's now we've crossed Pease River and homeward we are bound
No more in that hell-fired country shall ever be found
Go home to our wives and sweethearts; tell others not to go
For God's forsaken the buffalo range and the damned old buffalo

On a dead end street
In a dead end town
There's a motel that I call home
Just a few small hopes
And a few small dreams
Is all that place is resting on

Desiree lives two doors down
She's been there for way too long
Oh Yeah!
Sometimes when she's feelin' down
you know I hope she hears this song

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
She deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

She comes home late everynight
I can hear her walkin' down my hall
She don't talk on the phone too much
When she does I hear it through my wall

Desiree don't have many friends
At least not many good ones
I may be just an ordinary man
But at least I'm someone to lean on

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
She deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

Tonight; tonight; tonight; tonight
Tonight; tonight; tonight; tonight

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light

Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to.
Harold's club is closing; and everybody's going on home:
What's a poor boy to do?

I'll just get on back into my short; make it back to the fort
Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain.
There's got to be some place that's better than this
This life I'm leading's driving me insane

And let me tell you I'm dreaming...

Let me tell you that  I'm dreaming to the twilight; this town has got me down.
I've seen all the highlights; I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss; I'll take a Greyhound bus; carry me away from here:
Tell me; what have I got to lose?

'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing; 'cause it's quarter to two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
Those I leave behind are catching up on me;
Let me tell you they're catching up on me; they're catching up on me
Catching up on me; catching up on me; catching up on me.

Two sides to every story

One man's drink is another man's thirst
One man's pleasure is another man's pain
One man's loss is another man's gain
One man's lie is another man's truth
There's two sides to every story

Well; good guys; bad guys all the same
Good guys win; bad guys get blamed
I don't care what side you're on
You might be right; you might be wrong

And one man's freedom is another man's prison
One man's honor is another man's shame
One man's guilty; one man isn't
There's two sides to every story

One man's heaven is another man's hell
One man's buy is another man's sell
One man's day is another man's night
One man's peace is another one's fight
One man's loss is another one's glory (glory)

I called up my friend LeRoy on the phone
I said; Buddy; I'm afraid to be alone
'Cause I got some weird ideas in my head
About things to do in Denver when you're dead

I was working on a steak the other day
And I saw Waddy in the Rattlesnake Cafe
Dressed in black; tossing back a shot of rye
Finding things to do in Denver when you die

You won't need a cab to find a priest
Maybe you should find a place to stay
Some place where they never change the sheets
And you just roll around Denver all day

LeRoy says there's something you should know
Not everybody has a place to go
And home is just a place to hang your head
And dream of things to do in Denver when you're dead

You won't need a cab to find a priest
Maybe you should find a place to stay
Some place where they never change the sheets
And you just roll around Denver all day
You just roll around Denver all day

We are supposed to act as each other's cover

Yo; it ain't no joke
We're at each other's throat - Aowl; Aowl

Treating our fellow-man far worse than illegal

We're at each other's throat - Aowl; Aowl

Another fatality caused by a family feud
Charged; tried; sentenced by the jury of a brother's gun
Made sister's fiancee's wedding never to be sung
He didn't like the way he treated the girl
So the boy played God; pow; he ended his world

He made a plea for temporary insanity
But left his sister insane permanently
This ain't new; this stuff happens everyday
Somebody doesn't like someone so they blow them away
Too fast for reason; too quick to negotiate

Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late
Jealousy for power; greed for possession
Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression
Speaking of which I'm truly not impressed
So if seeing is believin'- I don't wanna see the mess

Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser
As if for negativity we got the vapors
Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor
Cause we are too busy at each other's throat

Each other's throat
Each other's throat
Yo; it ain't no joke
We're at each other's throat -Aowl; Aowl

With a friend of mine
Had a couple of beers
And a bottle of wine
There were plenty of women
Dancing everywhere
They were dressed to kill
And knew what to do
She was so outstanding
I just had to make her mine
She could read me like a letter
I had one thing on my mind
She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is fine
She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is mine
So we left the party
And went to her place
You could see excitement
Written on my face
So she took me upstairs
Laid me on her bed
When she god undressed
I just lost my head
There were twenty years of woman
There was more than I could eat
She was ready; ripe 'n' willing
I just knew she's taste so sweet
She's got everything; etc.
She was like a fire
She burned like a flame
She cried out my name
In her claim to fame
Then I saw her smiling
From her pretty eyes
She said little boy
We've got work to do
Put the log into the fire
And bullets in the gun
You'll get what you desire
'Cause the night has just begun
She's got everything etc.

I see people in love and I don't know why
They can't seem to fight it and they don't even try
Guess it's because it makes the world go around
Yeah; we're spinning through space on shaky ground

I see people in love and I'm glad I'm not
It's just a disease and thank god I ain't got it
I see 'em holding hands; makes me wince
Yeah; she's just trying to turn that frog into a prince

Oh; movie stars smooching in an old movie
A kid turns away; says it's 'yucky'
That kid knows something that the grown-ups don't
When the kid grows up; after that the kid won't

People in love; I wanna laugh
Check out the statistics; take a look at the graph
On the park bench sits mister and miss
He's trying to make her his princess with his wake-up kiss

People in love; people in love; people in love

You'd think that you could make a person be what you want
But the chances aren't slim; the chances are gone
People ain't people; Streisand sang it
But the chances aren't slim the chances are fat

Hey; people in love I wanna yell
Right now your in heaven; but you'll end up in hell
You think that your safe and that you're home free
And that love lasts forever; that's the big fantasy

I see people in love and I feel sorry for them
There's petals on the rose; there's a thorn on the stem
Like famine and earthquake; love's part of the plan
Mother nature's inhumanity towards man

People in love; people in love; people in love

So you pick up a check and you prepare a meal
Suddenly you're thinking that you're somebody's ideal
You know that you're different; but you know you can change
You wanna be normal; but people are strange

Hey; people in love and it makes me sick
I wanna run up and tell 'em it's a trap and a trick
I been through it and I know what they're gonna go through
Not so long ago; I went through it with you

I'd be in your town.
I might not stay; but at least I would have been around

Is it coincidence?
Or was it meant to be.

'Cos there's something' about what happens when we talk
Somethin' about what happens when we talk.

And conversation with you;
was like a drug.
It wasn't your face so much as it was your words.

'Cos there's somethin' about what happens when we talk.
Somethin' about what happens when we talk.

I can't stick around; I'm goin' back south.
But all I regret now;
Is I never kissed your mouth.

Cos there's somethin' about what happens when we talk.
Somethin' about happens when we talk.

[Jonathon]
The tarot is fate; said the Gypsy Queen
And she beckoned me; to glimpse my future she'd seen

[Gypsy to Jonathon]
She said; do you see what I see?; be careful to choose
Be careful what you wish for; cause it may come true
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?
Will it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose

[Jonathon to the Gypsy]
I'm the lost boy can you help me
Yeah; I'm the lost boy can you help me

[Jonathon]
Then the illusion was real; a crimson idol I saw
But the higher he'd fly; then the further he'd fall

[Jonathon to the Gypsy]
I'm the lost boy can you help me
Yeah; I'm the lost boy can you help me

[Jonathon to the Gypsy]
I just wanna be; I just wanna be; I just wanna be
The crimson Idol of a million
I just wanna be; I just wanna be; I just wanna be
The crimson Idol of a million eyes
Of a million

The Wildhearts,Liberty Cap,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildhearts/libertycap.html,"

Clouded grey and blue my mind is ten miles high and rising
Misty waters calling down surrounding me with healing
To rise; to climb above the chaos; and wash away the filth
To hide inside my reason; the only one I need
And all I can remember is all I can forget
To taste you is to trust you
I'm hitting that high; I'm hitting that high...

Leave me be man I just wanna be on my own
Leave me be man I just wanna be on my own
I've got sickness in my head; I got spiders in my bed
I said; leave me be man; I just wanna be on my own

Twist myself around the wreathing corridors around me
Embryo I am my mother smothers me in safety
My own; I could be here beside you; in sickness and in health
Gonna [?] me so I need it
I'm hitting that high; I'm hitting that high...

Leave me be man I just wanna be on my own
Leave me be man I just wanna be on my own
I've got sickness in my head; I got spiders in my bed
I said; leave me be man; I just wanna be on my own

I'm coming down; I'm coming down; I'm coming down...

Loudon Wainwright III,Sometimes I Forget,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loudonwainwrightiii/sometimesiforget.html,"

Sometimes I forget that you've gone
You've gone; and you're not coming back
And it's hard to believe that you're still not here
What's left behind; disputes that fact
And your bookcase still holds all your books
It's as if all you've done is go out of town
You'll be back soon; that's just how it looks
But your suitcase is empty; it's right here in the hall
That's not even the strangest thing
Why would you leave your wallet behind
Your glasses; your wristwatch and ring
Your glasses; your wristwatch and ring

Sometimes I forget that you've gone
That we'll never see you again
I think for a moment; I've got to give him a all
But I can't now I realize that
No we can't meet for lunch at the usual place
The place where we always would go
And there was something I wanted to tell you so bad
Something I knew that you'd want to know
I could go by myself to our old haunt
That seems like such a strange thing to do
The waiters would wonder what was going on
Why weren't you there; where were you
Why weren't you there; where were you

Sometimes I forget that you've gone
I remember and I feel the ache
How could it have happened; how could it be
It's not true; there must be some mistake
Momentos; memories; tell me what good are they
No they're not much to have and to hold
And it's true that you're gone
And you're not coming back
And this world seems so empty and cold
But sometimes things happen
It doesn't seem strange
You're not far away; you're near
Sometimes I forget that you've gone
Sometimes it feels like you're right here
Right now it feels like you're right here

The ocean doesn't want me today
But I'll be back tomorrow to play
And the stranglers will take me
Down deep in their brine
The mischievous braingels
Down into the endless blue wine

All of my time
I'd love to go drowning
And to stay and to stay
But the ocean doesn't want me today
I'll go in up to here

All they will find is my beer
And my shirt
A rip tide is raging
And the life guard is away

If you never plan to come out of your shell; you're never gonna get well.
I understand your reasons not to.
What you don't know is what you're afraid of.
And I'm afraid of it too
But can I even talk to you again?

Oh part of me wants to call you up; and talk to you like a friend.
And there's a part of me that wants to shut you out
And never see your face again.

[Chorus:]
How can we be like enemies when we're only flesh and blood?
What does it take to make your heart bleed; Daddy aren't we enough?
You can get through there's nothing stopping you from getting to us
No one can take a way the fact that we're only...flesh and blood
For years I've been following your case; It's the only time I see your face
And we've learned to live without you.
Who you don't know is who you're afraid of
And we're afraid of you too
But will we ever talk to you again?

Oh part of me wants to call you up; just talk to you like a friend
There's a part of me that wants to shut you out
And never see your face again.

I want to make you laugh; and I want a chance to know you better.
I want to hear you sing beside me now.
We're just like you.

I want to make you laugh; I want a chance to know you better
I want to hear you sing beside me now... flesh and blood

I want to hear you sing beside me now

The Wallflowers,Sugarfoot,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wallflowers/sugarfoot.html,"

Sugarfoot's got two hands
Just as long as he can see;
One hand in the birdfeed
And a hand in the apple tree.
He stands in line; just a little behind
A yellow moon that hangs;
he's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links
Of his own chain gang.

You oughta see this home that he own;
It's like a box of jewelry;
He's got his own church bell
And his bed it lays in a gallery.
And all the colors they shine like flames
Coming in through the window pane;
They end up getting checked over twice
For the reds of someone's veins.

It's so cold and blown all apart;
It's so cold and needing of a heart.

He stands alone on the top of his home
Where all the blue birds flown;
Sucks in on his cheeks and he cries
As he moans through a saxophone.
He reaches high with his hands in the sky
And puts his fingers right into the storm
Always one to stand under the moon
And blow on his own horn.
And anyone with anything has already begun to think
That somebody down there knows
Just how he sat down on his knees in the dirt
And buried someone's rainbow.

It's so cold and blown all apart;
It's so cold and needing of a heart.

It's so cold and blown all apart;
It's so cold and needing of a heart.

Well; I know you ain't my enemy;
The only one's inside of me;
He's killing me getting free.
I hear he wants my head with an old ice pick
And fix me up on a stick.
An' all I've ever got to be
Is everything I wanna be
And Sugarfoot disagrees;
He still stands tall underneath that apple tree
Man; he's still watching me.
His chain gang is tryin' to pull me down
Like the birds and the fireflies.
They shoot arrows up into the skies
And they burn all the feathers dry.
Well; he only wants to fill his belly up
With rocks till it hurts; then he stops.
Well; he don't know what to do with love
If it don't fill his belly to the top.

It's so cold and blown all apart;
It's so cold and needing of a heart.

It's so cold and blown all apart;
It's so cold and needing of a heart.

Warrant,The Bitter Pill,1992,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/warrant/thebitterpill.html,"

Sometimes I'm lost
And then I'm found
Sometimes I feel
Turned inside out
I'm often silent when I'm screaming inside

Instead of love
We tend to hate
We never quite
Appreciate
How much the other person cares or tries

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

And when I'm right
I'm also wrong
We give and take
To get along
There's so much more to this than I ever dreamed

And when you smile
I have to laugh
And when you cry
I'm torn in half
So calm and yet so loose at the seams

Oh
Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains it pours
You're such a mystery
Why can't I unlock the door
All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill
Love can be beautiful
Or a bitter pill

Liebe kann eine bittere pille sein
Eine bittere pille
Liebe ist eine bittere pille
Eine bittere pille
Liebe kann eine bittere pille sein
Ich will ein bier
Ich will besoffen sein
Die ganze welt ist dumm
Mir steht es so im hals
Ich sage dir
Die liebe kann nur luge sein

Hold me close
Don't ever let me go
Cause I'm confused
But maybe someday I will know why

Sometimes I'm right as rain
And when it rains it pours
You're such a mystery

All that glitters isn't gold
Too much is overkill

You were both believers from the time you met
But time has a way of making believers forget
Now words are worthless and tears can't bring you 'round
Nothing is sacred when it finally comes down to

One believer still hanging on
One who won't leave the one who's already gone
One who's forever; one who's over and done
Ain't nothing lonelier than one believer

When someone stops trying love can't be saved
Where there's no will to leave me; there ain't no way
Take it from someone who knows just how you feel
You can't get down the road with only one wheel

One believer still hanging on
One who won't leave the one who's already gone
One who's forever; one who's over and done
Ain't nothing lonelier than one believer

One believer

One believer
Oh; one believer

Ooo; one believer

Words and music by dar williams

Ron and Nancy got the house but Sid and Nancy rule
I died eight years ago; I'm still a legend at my high school
I stole a Chevy and I wrapped it 'round a tree
But that's OK cause no one's gonna make the next century
I'm up in heaven now they say I'm here to stay
Where the clouds are really puffy and the angels sing every day
Alleluia; alleluia; alleluia; wo-oh...

The cafeteria's got everything it's gonna drive you mad
'Cause it looks just like a big Hawaiian party that my mother had
It's like the worst Elvis film I've ever seen
Technicolor luau all on technicolor green
There's camping trips and donkey rides and singing round the fire
And they signed me up for surfing
But they can't get me in the choir
Alleluia; alleluia; alleluia; wo-oh...

But there she was this morning getting fitted for her wings
Leather boots; magenta hair; and saying nasty things
I'd say she was an angel but it's stupid and it's obvious
I said ""you'll hate it here cause we're the only ones like us""

It's crypto-fascist mania it's silicon deliria
""Yeah;"" she said; ""you're right; but I like the cafeteria""

Hey God; we're the bad kids; we're so nasty mean and vile
God looks like a guidance counselor; God's got that smile
God says; ""How could this be; that's really odd
I guess I'll have to check my records; silly me; you know; I'm only
God.""

The waves are perfect and the sun will always shine
But there's got to be more to death than surfing all the time
I know the signs of self-destruction so I try to stop each new kid
Don't be like me; forever young; forever stupid
Yeah; I found love here but I'll bet you'll find it there
Where they don't always make the same joke
Gee you make a heavenly pair
Alleluia; alleluia; alleluia; alleluia

The Wildhearts,And The Bullshit Goes On,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildhearts/andthebullshitgoeson.html,"

Life; you think it's all in your hands; you play tricks; manipulating the band
You want fame; well here you are in the track and all without a spinal column in your back

You make waves while being jealous and weak; you want stars unless they happen to speak
You use blackmail tactics as part of your plan to undermine the battle of the working man

So we just play and smile all day at things you say and do
And use our little victories as trial for the few
And that means you

And the bullshit goes on; it don't matter how far you run
It's that old familiar feeling when they're all convinced you're wrong
It's just different words and the same old fucking song
And the bullshit goes on

And it goes...

You pass blame because you think you're immune
And when your fingers should be itching to reopen the wound
You go on and on and on some more; your stupid ideas that we all ignore

So take your place and hide your face and we'll get on just fine
Keep the distance; earn respect and we'll work it out in time

I want you to see some honesty you believe it's true
So come on open up to me like human beings are supposed to do
So won't you

It goes

Mojo Dollar came riding into town in a '57 Chevrolet
Yeah; he had a 3030 rifle and a red bone hound
Said he wanted to make a trade
I seen him come out of the pawn shop with a guitar in his hand
And it froze me in my tracks when I looked into the eyes of a wild man

I heard the stories when I was just a young boy
People said that Mojo wasn't right
I couldn't get it out of my head so when everyone went to bed
I slipped out the backdoor late that night
Well; I came up on his Chevy and I was scared of going on
But I followed his trail and went deep into wild man swamps

Well; I knew I couldn't turn back when I found his little ol' shack
And Mojo had a big fire in the yard
I couldn't hear a word he said but his eyes rolled back in his head
He just kept on rompin' that ol' guitar
There was hoot owls callin' there were wild cats pantin'
Snakes were crawlin' Mojo started dancin'
He was a wild man he was a wild man

I've tried to forget it but it ain't no use
There are some who don't believe and some who do
But I'm telling it like it is there's still some things going on
And whatever you do don't go down to wild man swamps

Dar Williams,In Love But Not At Peace,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/darwilliams/inlovebutnotatpeace.html,"

Love took a long time; it followed me here
And it landed on light feet; and it whispered in my ear
Love spoke of my past as a valuable test
And smiled; and said she who loves last loves best
'Cause you know life is hard; but now you also know your mind
So now you're going out to love; but on your own side this time
Where you still think of famine; and you still dig up train fare
And you won't mind the wrinkles; 'cause you know how they got there
In love but not at peace
In love but not at peace

Once for me love was the boat inside of a bottle
It felt like a gondola ride
When you float with the nicknacks; and you don't hear a sound
Where the fish never lived; and you don't miss the ground
And the moon hangs above like a Valium pill
And I say I'll be fine; but I don't think that I will
But today I got work; and I like it that way
It's a case of a still life gone cinéma verité
In love but not at peace
In love but not at peace

And I still need the beauty of words sung and spoken
And I live with the fear that my spirit will be broken
And that's the way I thought it would be
That's the way I always wanted it to be

So I'll keep you wondering what time I'm arriving
And you'll drive me crazy with your backseat driving
And I'll talk in my sleep and you'll steal all the covers
We'll argue it out and we'll call ourselves lovers
And I'll stay in my body and you'll stay in your own
'Cause we know that we're born and we're dying alone
So we turn out the light while the sirens are screaming
And we kiss for the waking; and then join the dreaming
In love; but not at peace
In love; but not at peace

No shadow

No moon
No care

It only believes
In a pile of dead leaves
And a moon

No prayers for November
To linger longer
Stick your spoon in the wall
We'll slaughter them all

November has tied me
To an old dead tree
Get word to April
To rescue me
November's cold chain

Made of wet boots and rain
And shiny black ravens
On chimney smoke lanes
November seems odd
You're my firing squad
November

With my hair slicked back
With carrion shellac
With the blood from a pheasant
And the bone from a hare

Tied to the branches
Of a roebuck stag
Left to wave in the timber
Like a buck shot flag

Go away you rainsnout
Go away; blow your brains out

In a boarding house; I'd lay upstairs
And dream of how I'd live someday
Downstairs there sat; a man who had
A guitar he never learned to play

For my thirteenth birthday; grandma bought the guitar
Told me I should learn how to play
And the gift she gave me changed me
'Cause the music is the main thing
That got me to this point here today

And I was lucky; 'cause I used her gift
To get in touch with how to live
And looking back I now realize; music changed my life

Just out of school; I had no clue
Of what it was I'd like to do
I only know; the open road
Was the way I chose to pass on through

I took that guitar with me; down the lonesome highway
And I began my search for a song
And somewhere in the distance; the music and the mystery
Of how I would live come along

Chorus (Last line different)
That music saved my life; music became my life

As time went by; I found that I
Could climb up on the stage and sing
But when I sang; the songs I wrote
It became a very special thing

But songs to me were personal
And the business side just killed me
And I withdrew inside my shell
With the contracts and the lawsuits
I started heavy drinking
Till I finally lost touch with myself

I guess playing music for money brought problems
That I didn't face very well
Being self-taught gave me nothing to lean on
I had to look in myself

I took a year off and did some fasting
Just to clean the cobwebs out
And I went back to Grandma's guitar
Just to hear a simple sound

When I look around me; I saw my loving family
And a home we had built on a hill
I discovered the music had led me to the one place
Where my heart and soul are re-filled

Music saved my life; yeah; music really saved my life
Yes; music really saved my life

You don't get it back - that's economics
Gets to my head; is it good for my health?
And it was something else

Well; it was something else

If life; if life; if life; if life
If life; if life; if life; if life
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft

Well; everyone will take until there's nothing left to give

If...

If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft
If life is like a love bank; I want an overdraft

Clay Walker,Down By The Riverside,1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/claywalker/downbytheriverside.html,"

The wind was blowing through your hair
The moon was shing on your face
You looked like a picture sittin' there
And time stood still there in that place
The water was singin'; out hearts were beatin' fast
Two high school lovers thinkin' it would always last

Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside

Now you're nothin' but a ghost
That still haunts my memory
And you're always waitin' there
When I go walkin' through my dreams
There's no happy ending but I know our love will last
'Cause when I close my eyes you always take me back

Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside

On a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take

Oh; can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby; baby; please...

Oh; can't you see
You belong to me

You're all that I need in the world

Cold and hungry cryin' on the phone
You baked me brownies and said; 'Don't you cry'
And gave me the coat off your back

And say to me that you'd do anything
And all I can do is say that
I haven't much I can give you in return
Only my heart and a promise not to turn
But I sing to you every day and every night

Burning love takes a toll

Looking at the clock
See it's time to go
Time to get movin'
Take the Gonzo show down the road
I told Freddy to get ready
Loosen up the kit
After this song we're long gone
That's that and this is it

I hope everybody here is really feeling fine
Speakin' for myself and the band
We've had a hell of a time
We laughed and cried and we carried on
Everybody sang a sing-along
Had a good time; time we was movin' on

Guys like us are happy
Every place we go
We never stay long; no
That's the rule of the open road

We don't like it
We don't take it
We simply leave it there
When we can't impress anymore
We pick it up and leave you there

I hope everybody here is really feeling fine
Speakin' for myself and the band
We've had a hell of a time
We laughed and cried and we carried on
Everybody sang a sing-along
Had a good time; time we was movin' on

Yeah; everybody here was great
And we liked it fine
But there's other people waiting for us down the line
We don't want to overstay our welcome here you see
When we come back next time
Think how happy we'll be

Now the right one is turning
The wheels are in the well
Whether we're remembered; only time'll tell
It's a crazy business; making people sing and dance
But we don't even think about it
We step up; we take a chance

I hope everybody here is really feeling fine
Speakin' for myself and the band
We've had a hell of a time
We laughed and cried and we carried on
Everybody sang a sing-along

There's a wood stove in the corner
There's saw dust on the floor
They've got a flashing neon lone star sign
Hangin' by the door
All they sell is beer and setups
So you'll have to bring your own
But when they play that swing it only means one thing
You're gonna boogie till the cows come home

'Faded Love' and 'Milk Cow Blues'
'The Oklahoma Stomp' and 'Born to lose'
Tip your hat to the 'Rose of San Antone'
Here we go with the 'Cotton Eyed Joe'
We're gonna boogie till the cows come home

It's an old Southwest tradition
And a guaranteed good time
And there's people of all ages here
From one to ninety-nine
Even if you show up by yourself
You don't have to be alone

We speak out like children
Of the dreams that we chase and pursue
These rights we hold precious
Say it loud enough
And it'll be true
In the company of strangers
Wild conversation
And the hours go by so fast
And you find a lot of wisdom there
At the bottom of the glass
But when the lights go down
And the laughter fades away
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars
All of life certainties they
They all just slip away
And you lie down in god's shadow
At the end
The end of the day
We speak revolution
But the future's already been sold
The masters of diffusion
Spinning their fine webs into gold
And the party's just begun
This matter of resistance
Our ship was built to last
We¹re sailing out on troubled seas
Nail your colors to the mast

Join with all nature in manifold witness

This is so far from china
The star light like to blind ya
A lover's way of saying come home soon
Put it in a letter
Let each star there remind ya
It's time for love to find ya

When a comet comes out to fall
Why on earth do we feel so small
Must be heaven that we hear call
And in this natural planet
I feel like catching your hand
Out under our palm tree and moon

I put it in a letter
How could I love you better
And dropped it in a bottle in the sea
Put it in a letter
I don't know where it went so

I sent to Sacramento
Said you were meant for me

What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
There ain't a cloud in the sky
No allowin' for why
Out under our palm tree and moon

Hoo do you
Hoo do you
Put it in a letter
Put it in a letter
You were meant for me

What a time to be talking small
But a crime not to talk at all
When it's heaven that we hear call
And for us two silhouettes
It's just as good as it gets
Out under our palm tree and moon

Shadows over me and

Inside of me; all I wanna see's
The colours in my head
I'm in black the only way
And make it black forever
Go inside and go inside and
Never come back out again

Don't colourize me
Cause I don't want it
The ravens taken over my soul
The only thing I want is
The only way I wanna go

The reds were in my head; the blues were in my soul
Swirl in my mind; never let go
Blind my eyes with a cold embrace
I'll lay my veil all across my face
Everyone I used to know
Sees me strange; sees me bold
Everything I used to hold
Will fade away my soul

No confessions and no regrets
I'll paint the black all across my chest
Gimme darkness and gimme rest
Gimme blackness or gimme death

Haul out the holly
Put up the tree before my spirit falls again
Fill up the stocking; I may be rushing things
But deck the halls again now
For we need a little Christmas

Right this very minute
Candles in the window
Carols at the spinet
Yes; we need a little Christmas

Right this very minute
It hasn't snowed a single flurry
But Santa; dear; we're in a hurry
So climb down the chimney

Put up the brightest string of lights
I've ever seen; slice up the fruitcake
It's time we hung some tinsel
On that evergreen bough

For I've grown a little leaner
Grown a little colder
Grown a little sadder
Grown a little older

And I need a little angel
Sitting on my shoulder
Need a little Christmas now

Haul out the holly
Well; once I taught you all
To live each living day

Fill up the stocking

But Auntie man; it's one week
From Thanksgiving Day now

But we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute
Candles in the window

Carols at the spinet
Yes; we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute

It hasn't snowed a single flurry
But Santa dear; we're in a hurry

So climb down the chimney
Put up the brightest string of lights
I've ever seen

Slice up the fruitcake
It's time we hung some tinsel
On that evergreen bough

For we need a little music
Need a little laughter
Need a little singing
Ringing through the rafter

And we need a little snappy
Happy ever after
Need a little Christmas now
Need a little Christmas now

I suppose that I could love you
Though my mind tells me; ""No way""
It says ""Screw it; you've been through it""
It's not worth the price you pay
Than it reminds me of the last time
Each gorey detail
It's a drag that tells me; ""Bag it""
No; my memory doesn't fail

And I suppose that I could love you
If my heart were still intact
It keeps ticking; but not tricking me
Like it used to; that's a fact
I have been burned and I have learned
To let the muscle do it's job
I let it beat; it's no mean feat
No; it doesn't need to throb

I suppose that I could love you
If I wasn't so afraid; I might go berserk
If it did work and I didn't feel betrayed
I have writing off love for so long now
That's all I know to do
But if it's real this thing we feel
Well; then yes; I could love you

A long time ago left my home
For job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me

So I sent my wages to my home
Said; we'd soon be 'gether
For the next good crop; pay my way
And I'd come home forever

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills; boys; I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home

No work; said the boss at bunkhouse door
There's freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at bar downtown
I rolled and took my chances

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills; boys; I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home

A long time ago left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
My luck has turned against me

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills; boys; I'll never roam
Just one more dollar and I'm going home

Black stone; shining gem -
Don't want to fall in no Devil's Den.
You're thrown a line; so you hold on tight.
So many wonders to be seen.
It don't come easy and you work to be free -
There is no guarantee. 

You're on your own;
Trying your best not to fall.
You're on your own;
Trying to make sense of it all. 

Golden path; land of dreams;
Enchanted kingdom
Not all it seems.
Royal realm; rules within.
A sacred journey; where to begin?
You could be home tending the fire;
You could nothing at all;
But if you want to reach for something higher
You gotta scale that wall. 

You're on your own...

Jagged edge meets the sky;
Crystal vision flows on by.
As you reach for the stars;
Then you find who you really are.
Nothing ventured; nothing gained.
Nothing ever stays the same.
You search your soul; as yet untamed;
It can bring you pleasure or pain. 

You're on your own...

To Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies
My darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies.

Dear friend there'll be no sad farewells
No sad... farewells
There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
No tear...  dimmed eyes
Where all is joy; peace and love
Where all... is joy
And the soul of man never dies
And the soul... never dies.

A garden's blooming there for me
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies
And I shall spend eternity
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies.

Dear friend there'll be no sad farewells
No sad... farewells
There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
No tear...  dimmed eyes
Where all is joy; peace and love
Where all... is joy
And the soul of man never dies
And the soul... never dies.

A love-light beams across the foam
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies
It shines to light the fires of home
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies.

My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies.

I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul... never dies.

You
Doing that thing you do
Breaking my heart into a million pieces
Like you always do
And you
Don't mean to be cruel
You never even knew about the heartache
I've been going through

Well; I try and try to forget you; girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing you do
I know all the games you play
And I'm gonna find a way to let you know that
You'll be mine someday

'Cause we
Could be happy; can't you see?
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me

'Cause I try and try to forget you; girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing you do

I don't ask a lot; girl (I don't ask a lot; girl)
But I know one thing's for sure (know one thing's for sure)
It's the love I haven't got; girl
And I just can't take it anymore

'Cause we
Could be happy; can't you see?
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me
'Cause it hurts me so just to see you go
Around with someone new

And if I know you; you're doing that thing
Every day just doing that thing
I can't take you doing that thing you do

He stands in the rain begging for change as people pass him by
And once in a while; he'll get a nod or a smile with nickels and dimes
But when the sun goes down in his part of town and cold wind blows
He'll find his way in the dark to a bench in the park where no one knows

Someone used to rock him on their knee
And when he's cry; they'd sing him lullabies till he was fast asleep
They say he had his daddy's eyes; his momma's smile
Oh; they loved him so; but that was long ago when he was someone's child

The word on the street was he had a degree & a big house in LA
But when it comes to his past; don't bother to ask 'cause he's got nothing to say
People frown and put him down; no one seems to care
That that's one of us down on his luck standing there

Someone used to rock him on their knee
And when he's cry; they'd sing him lullabies till he was fast asleep
They say he had his daddy's eyes; his momma's smile
Oh; they loved him so; but that was long ago when he was someone's child

Then the flashing lights light up the night and the sirens scream
And as he breaths his last breath; he drops a photograph that no one's seen
They say he had his daddy's eyes; his momma's smile
Oh; they loved him so; but that was long ago when he was someone's child

Living on the side
Of Primrose Hill
Drinking cans of Tennants
Just can't seem to get my fill
Got a beat up guitar
And a dirty old sleeping bag
And this mangy dog
Whose tail don't wag
Sun's been shining down
On my hillside bed
That's not the only reason
My face is so red
This nasty cut on my nose
Is not from no fight
I just fell down yesterday
Or maybe it was last night
And I used to sing and play
Down in the underground
But a few years back
They started cracking down
Now I'm living on the side
Of Primrose Hill
I'm no tourist attraction
But I give them a thrill

Yeah I see you
Riding by on your flash bicycle
Yeah they can do you for that on Primrose Hill
A pretty young mother goes by
She's pushing her pram
Her little baby leans out
Just to see what I am
From the top of the hill
There's a hell of a view
Houses of Parliament and London Zoo
Those politicians all chatter
They trumpet and roar
That must be what those hyenas all
Are laughing for
When you come up to London
It sure is something to see
It's somewhere to go
But it's no place to be
And there's two things
Keeping me from going 'round the bend
I got my music
And this dog for a friend

'Cause life gets slippery
When you're living on the side
Yeah I know I should quit drinking
But I haven't even tried
My mutt's licking my fingers
And I'm wetting my lips
I got a can of extra strong
And a bag of chicken and chips
If I had a little money
I'd get a few things
Like a bottle of vodka
And a pack of new guitar strings
I guess I could die here
On the side of this hill
I'm no tourist attraction
But I'd give them a chill
And I'm living on the side
Of Primrose Hill
Drinking cans of Tennants
Just can't seem to get my fill
Got a beat up guitar
And dirty old sleeping bag

BeBe Winans,Love's Coming,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bebewinans/lovescoming.html,"

Two things you promised me
The world and ecstacy
But all you've given are material things
When what I'm looking for
Sums up to so much more
And if nothing less I'm sure not settling
I lay awake in bed
Wonder what lies ahead
And in tomorrow said
What will it bring
No more concern myself 
About this commons wealth
My futures on the shelf and I still believe

[Chorus]
I'm waiting
Waiting is easy
Cause I know; love's coming and make it alright.
Can't worry; don't see the need to;
Cause I know love's coming and make it alright.

It's not a game I play
When asked if I'm o.k.;
I've learned to smile and say
Everythings fine.

I made my heart decide
O yes I will survive;
It's time to come alive
My turn to shine

My course about to change; 
It feels a little strange;
Leaving behind the pain;
I've known all my life;

Ooh it's time to soar above;
I know that it must be love;
You are the meaning of and wont say good-bye;
Good-bye.

[Bridge]
Only thing I need to know;
Is that I'll never let you go;
I've waited patiently;
And now you're standing here;
Next to me

Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven sawmill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind

The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a sawmill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girl's appetite
I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson
Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind

I'm the man you thought I'd never be
The boy who you reduced to tears
Lad called 'thingy' for six whole years.

The one who landed the pop star's job
The one you told; look don't touch
The kid who wouldn't amount to much. 

Well; I'm here and you're still there
With a fake sports car and receding hair.
Dodgy Farah trousers that you think are smart
Married to the woman who teaches art. 

Married to the life; married to the school
I wanna sing and dance Sir; now who's the fool?
Sing and dance; you thought I was barmy
Settle down thingy; join the army. 

And who are you to tell me this?
The dream I want I'll have to miss
Sir is God; he's been given the right
To structure lives overnight. 

Now I know life's true path
Tanks and guns that'll be a laugh
No; not me I'm a mega civilian
I won't lead my life riding pillion. 

But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do
For the negative dickheads just like you.
As for now I've a different weapon
Stage and sceen is about to beckon.

Since this old house was built

It held a grieving widow
When my daddy's daddy died
And now it rocks my children
When they close their sleepy eyes

With a quarter karat ring

Been a witness to some good times

We knew he had to go and fight

And never said a thing

Yonder to dreams that rarely come true
As far as I can see
From the island of green

And only love sails straight from the harbor
And only love will lead us to the other shore
Out of all the flags I've flown
One flies high and stands alone

Peaceful waters; raging sea

I can close my eyes and still be free
When the waves come crashing down 
And the thunder rolls around
I can feel my feet on solid ground

As though his heart would break
Then the Parson came over and took his hand
And to him these words he did say.

When God comes and gathers his jewels
All his treasures of diamonds and gold
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers his jewels.

You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted to'ard heaven

So try to repent and ask for forgiveness

Goodbye to this world; with all its sorrows
Goodbye to the fields; that I used to roam
I'm going away where; life is eternal
My Shepherd is callin me home.

From out of the sky; He's coming to meet me
To wash all my sins and call me His own
His servants will bring; a ring for my finger
And never no more will I roam.

In out of town spot; where I can make a profit
With a colored handkerchief hanging out my back pocket
Steady banging from my cheep ass on these fools

Bitches laughing at me cause I'm rolling a Bucket

Known someday I'll be that nigga they be jocking
Three years later; for sure it's on and popping

Broke as fuck; looking like that nigga Eddie Kane
The game is still the same; but the players done chance
Cause now I push luxuries on bang to Connect Gang
The Rich Rolling; the Four Fingers up; two twisted in the..
Oh! Fuck it; y'all know the slogan (For Sure!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: W.C.]
Now I done seen niggaz come; and seen niggaz go
Whack motherfuckers; sheezy ass videos
I've watched them fall up in charges like a brick
Talking that true MC can't keep a real shit
See; I love to freestyle; but if I can't get paid
At the end of the day; I'm like No! Comprende?
Cause if Keeping the Real is being broke
FUCK! this Rap shit; I'm going back to full-time slanging Coke
Laughing at this niggaz whose swearing they're the bomb
Working on their fourth albums still living with moms
Three Strikes you're out; pack your shit and shake
Stick to Flipping Burgers and making Mixtapes
Cause if 'It Don't Make Dollars; It Don't Make Sense'
And apparently them freestyles; ain't paying the Rent
So I'ma let you other motherfuckers keep on roll broken
And in the meanwhile; Dub-C gonna keep on rich rolling

[Outro: DJ Crazy Toones Scratching quote from 'West Up!']
Connect Gang.. Connect Gang.. Yeah; Uhh.. Crazy Toones
So busters be wary cause see we represent.. represent.. WESTSIDE!!
So busters be wary cause see we represent.. representing this.. WESTSIDE!!
WEST.. WEST.. WESTSIDE!!

Rufus Wainwright,Foolish Love,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rufuswainwright/foolishlove.html,"

I don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion
With eyes in love

I twist like a corkscrew
The sweetness rising
I drink from the bottle; weeping
Why won't you last?
Why can't you last

So i will walk without care
Beat my snare
Look like a man who means business
Go to all the poshest places
With their familiar faces
Terminate all signs of weakness
Oh; all for the sake of a foolish love

I will take my coffee black
Never snack
Hang with the wolves who are sheepish
Flow through the veins of town
Always frown
Me and my mistress; the princess
Oh; all for the sake of a foolish love

So the day noah's ark floats down park
My eyes will be simply glazed over
Or better yet
I'll wear shades on sunless days
And when the sun's out; i'll stay in and slumber
Oh; all for the sake of a foolish love
All for the sake of a foolish love

Cause i don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion
With eyes in love

Och sommaren fryser till is
Hela himlen ser hur solen går ner
Gatlamporna ser hur löven fallit ner
Och sommaren fryser till is

Sommarens skratt ekar bort
Över Saras och Mikaels stad
Och över fallna blad går kylan ner en grad
Och sommarens skratt ekar bort

Och sommaren släcker sin dag
Och vemod besöker vårat hus
Liksom tända ljus vid ett andetag
Släcker vår sommar sin dag

Och sommaren pyntar för snö
Och lämnar sitt avsked för att dö
Och himlen tar farväl och vintern intar själv
Och sommaren fryser ihjäl

Och gladjen byts ut mot den vackraste dag
Och värmen byts ut mot friska andetag
Och grönskan byts ut mot ett skimrande hav
Och snötäcken läggs över sommarens grav
Himlen lämnar över sitt pris
Och sommaren fryser till is

Fear in the night
Broken dreams - wrapped in starlight
Our love is dead

I cannot feel my mind
I cannot feel who's wrong or right

It's you or me
The strategy we know oh so well
The battle field lies deep down in our hearts
It's cold as hell
No compromise
We burn the last bridges down

Do you feel allright
We're drowning in blood sweat and tears
When love turns to fear.

We gonna shoot it out
Between you and me
When hearts turn to stone !
Love's in the danger zone

Stiletto heels
Run for your life
Shoot me down in flames
Kill my alibis
When we're talking every word
Is an act of war

When I call out your name in the night
I hear the sound of the master's voice.

I sent a prayer
Send me someone
Someone to care
Out of the blue
Suddenly you
Heaven sent

One magic touch
One stolen kiss
My only dream
My every wish
That's when I knew
That it was truly
Heaven sent

And every star in the sky
They knew that I
Had waited my whole life through
And as I held you tight
They shined even brighter
So glad; I'd finally found you

Never forget

The night we met
And how we knew
That it was truly

When the day is over
The devil is near
The people who know it
Are full of fear

When the devil is coming
A virgin will die
A soldier of the darkness
Will take her life

The demon takes the body
Of the bloodless gal
Outside she's looking pretty
Inside a beast of hell

That's what you are callin'
A hellcat or a witch
And only if she's burning
The demon will die

Burning the witches
The evil cries
By burning the witches
The demon dies
By burning the witches
The demon dies by fire

The witches are hunting
Your soul and your blood
And if you can't escape
They take all that you've got

A soul of the virgin
Can find no peace
Till the fire is killing
The witch - they can be free

Leavin' here without you
And the second hardest thing I'll ever do

How can I tell her now
That good ain't good enough?

The hardest thing I'll ever have to do
And it's holdin' her and lovin' you

If she'd give me one good reason I'd be gone
But she ain't done one thing wrong
So don't expect me just to walk out of the door

Drivin' a big ol' truck
Pedal to the metal; hope I don't run out of luck
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

My diesel rig is northward bound
It's time to put that hammer down
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel
While I'm waiting for my nails to dry

Oh; I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight
Well; I sure hope my seams are straight
Lord; don't let my mascara run tonight

Because I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck
Got these eighteen wheels-a-rollin' until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

Oh; I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much
But when I hit those big speed bumps
My darling little rhinestone pumps
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch

But still I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Headin' down the interstate; just tryin' to make a buck
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on

I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a truck
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck
And I'm late for my appointment down at my hair salon
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on

Goin down
Little Joe from Kokomo
It rattles to the ground
The dice is laughin at the

Your rollin over to the
Lowside of the road.

The moon is red and your
Dancin real slow
29 miles left to go
The chain momkeys
Help you with your load
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road

Jezebel is naked
With an axe
The prosecution tell you
To relax
Your head feels like it's ready
To explode
You're rollin over; you're rollin over

Well the clapper has been ripped
Out of the bell
The flapper has been kicked right
Out of hell
When the horse whips the
Man that he rode
You're rollin over to the Lowside of the road

The dog won't bite if you beat
Him with a bone
She's so shy when she's
Talkin on the phone
The round rises up and starts to groan
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road

The God that made her
And all of the creatures

Everybody guess if I'm an angel or sprite

And my hair clinging to my face in the rain
Like a goddess from the cult of beautiful pain

Smoke all night and leave the party alone
Screw myself with an inscrutable pout

My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin snoop as I swoop in the coupe
Stop by my homey dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone; floating on cloud one-nine
Liquor sto'; so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up two
Seven; eight; nine ten eleven twelve
Bailed back in the crib (for what?) because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug the hoe out
I fixed me some food; then go the hell out
Two a.m. on the dizot; I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeah; and I'm feeling alright
Four a.m. as I stoll back to my crib

Sliding through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hopping like a motherfucker trying to find a hoe
Hitting all the spots but I'm coming up blank

Parks my ride as I; steps inside; as I
Puts my nine double-m to my side; as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishing; wishing
Upon a star; to come up on some ends
But she caviar; and I let her bet her pussy
So I can get my pimp on
Cause my pen gets my pimp on from g to ozone

I have pimped my pen; on cold Michigan nights
And the bitch didn't freeze up on me; when I wanted her to write it
I have pimped my pen in the hot California sun
And the bitch didn't drip; smell; or run
As she turned the trick pages; from loose leaf to zig-zags
I have pimped my pen and she is number one in my stable
For I have yet not got a refill; for her
I love her that's why she keeps; performing for me
I have pimped my pen; and she is number one; in my stable
Pleasure; is the treasure that the girl sells all day
Pleasure is the reason that she brings daddy his cash
Dedicated the hoe; dedicate for sure
Dripping willows on satin pillows
Love is being checked; from a hoe
Dead presidents still getting their fuck on
I'm so happy because ain't nothing like a lollipop
That gets sucked; all day long
A tangy; little candy drop
I love it when she brings me the pay
Dedicated like everyday; to the sunshine
Yeah my hoe brings me mine
For like she says she does
And I believed her when I accept it
Yeah I got pimp bones in my body
And I rock them; like la-di-da-di
I rock them; mighty hardy; like la-di-da-di
I got pimp bones in my body

She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun
The girl from the canyon; the girl from the canyon
She was the only one.

An outlaw is a hunted one with a price upon his head
We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said
And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride
The girl from the canyon she was ridin' by my side.

The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I've done
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun
The girl from the canyon; the girl from the canyon
She was the only one.

She was the only one...

An empty street; an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone; the rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how; I wonder why; I wonder where they are
The days we had; the songs we sang together. (oh yeah)

And all my love; I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue; to see you once again... my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I Love The Most
Where the fields are green; to see you once again... my love

I try to read; I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking. (oh no)
I wonder how; I wonder why; I wonder where they are
The days we had; the songs we sang together. (oh yeah)

And all my love; I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue; to see you once again... my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I Love The Most
Where the fields are green; to see you once again...

To hold you in my arms
To promise you my love
To tell you from the heart
You're all I'm thinking of

Reaching for the love that seems so far

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue; to see you once again... my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I Love The Most
Where the fields are green; to see you once again... my love

Say it in a prayer (my sweet love)
Dreams will take it there
Where the skies are blue (woah yeah); to see you once again my love. (oh my love)
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I Love The Most
Where the fields are green; to see you once again.... My Love

If I tell you
Will you listen?
Will you stay?
Will you be here forever?
Never go away?

Never thought things would change
Hold me tight
Please don't say again
That you have to go

A bitter thought
I had it all
But I just let it go
Hold your silence
It's so violent
Since your gone

[REF:] All my thoughts are with you forever
Until the day we'll be back together
I will be waiting for you

If I had told you
You would have listened
You had stayed
You would be here forever
Never went away
It would never have been the same
All our time
Would have been in vain
Cause you had to go

The sweetest thought
I had it all
Cause I did let you go
All our moments
Keep me warm
When you're gone

Until the day we'll be back together

The footprints of the lovers that come here to love 
By the tides washed away forever more

If you can tell the secret of a warm friend's hand

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died

Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem Queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler; baby
Like you never seen; like you never seen; never seen

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died

How he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
He shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller; baby
With his soul at stake; with his soul at stake; soul at stake

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died

He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
He shook it and he shine like gold
He shook it and he beat that steam drill; baby
Well bless my soul; well bless my soul

He shook it and he beat that steam drill; baby
Well bless my soul; what's wrong with me?

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died; day that he died

Just a country boy that combed his hair
Put on a shirt his mother made and he went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
He shook it like a Harlem Queen

Thinking back when we first met  
I remember what You said  
You said You'd never leave me  
But I let go of your hand  
Build my castles in the sand  
But now I'm reaching out again  
And I'm not letting go 'till you... 

Hold me; Mold me  
Sometimes I feel so all alone  
See; I gotta find my way Back Home  
So why don't You  Shape me; Make me  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I gotta find my way...Back Home 

Master upon my knees I pray  
I just want to be the clay  
Put your arms around me  
Place my life in Your hands  
Lord I know I'm just human  
But you understand  
This time I'm not letting go 'till You... 

Hold me; Mold me

See; I gotta find my way Back Home  
So why don't You  Shape me; Make me

I've been wandering long enough to know  
Humbly I search for You  
And I'm not gonna rest 'till You...

I said it was over
I said we were through
I said when I left I
Was done loving you
But I'm fighting a feeling
That can't be denied
Forget what I told you
The truth is I lied

I know you weren't expectin'
This visit from me
With my hat in my hand and
My heart on my sleeve
But I've stopped my pretending
And I've swallowed my pride
I came here to tell you
The truth is I lied

The truth is I'm just not as strong as I thought
This battle is harder than any war that we've fought
I said I could just push your memory aside
And I meant it when I said it but the truth is I lied

Is it asking to much to forget and forgive
Dying for your love is no way to live
And the truth is I'm just not as strong as I thought
This battle is harder than any war that we've fought
I said I could just push your memory aside
I meant it when I said it but the truth is I lied

Every morning on my way to work
I stop off at Ernie's Corner Stand
He sees me comin' from a half a block away
He's got my mornin' paper in his hand

He probably thinks I read it for the headlines
Just another never-get-enough news junkie
But I round that corner and in no time
Life section D's in hand
The rest is in a garbage can

[Chorus:]

I still read your horoscope
'Cause I can't seem to give up hope
I've got to see what's up with Scorpio
Between that and Capricorn maybe I'll know
What you're goin' through
What I should do
Have you found someone new?
Are you going to?

Today it said that someone from your past
Would give you a call so well; ""hi""
And if you feel old feelings comin' back
Don't be surprised it said you might
I know you probably think I'm crazy
Puttin' stock in the stars and the constellation
Ooh but ever since I lost you baby
It's the only thing that I can do
To feel like I'm keepin' up with you

Life is like a roller coaster
It's up and down; it's over and over again
Till it ends
The way I figure it; it's grist for the mill
A lesson you learn in every hard spill you take
There's no mistake

We're all diamonds in the rough
We'll all shine soon enough
Struggles in this life can make you strong
We waste the good times and the bad
But keep in mind that when you're sad
Those tears of joy and sorrow lead you home
Every drop of water shapes the stone

You wouldn't know it by lookin' at me now
Not long ago; I was down for the count and scared
Didn't think I had a prayer
But I found the strength to get over that mountain
It took a little time; but nobody's countin' anyway
So I'm here to say

There's a masterpiece in every heart
An ever changing work of art

Life is kind of like a roller coaster
Up and down; over and over again
Till it ends

She likes candles and cut flowers; rearranging them for hours
And as she's lost in thought; I see the girl she was
I watch her standing in the kitchen
Snipping stems off with her scissors
And humming out a love song; like she always does
Then the flowers go in vases that appear in all the places
That gives the world around her; a little woman's touch

And she's the kind of woman; every woman wants to be like
And every man like me can't live without

Next she changes out the candles that have melted on the mantles
From the party that she hosted; just some nights ago
Then the round one on the piano; its unusual for the deep glow
That emanates inside it; when the wick is low
And the tall ones by the window; that she likes because the soft glow
Gives the room a feeling that she's not alone

And when she's not around you; you feel like something's missing
But the candles and the flowers say she's there

She likes dinners with old friends; late-night calls that come from girlfriends
She'll listen and tell them; if they're wrong or right
Later on she'll draw a hot bath; light a candle; play some soft jazz
Melt down in the bubbles; and the candlelight
Before bed she likes some white wine; says it helps her mind to unwind
As she reads a little while and drifts off in the night

And as she lies there sleeping; I can't believe she loves me
But when she says she loves you; you feel loved

She likes candles and cut flowers; rearranging them for hours
And as she's lost in thought; I see the girl she was

My heart was never really beating
Till you held me in your arms
And every love that didn't last

Simply disappeared into the dark

And the clock just froze
And the world stopped spinning
Now the magic of that moment is neverending
You made time stand still
And I'm loving every minute

A passion that is ageless
It consumes me like it did when it was new
You have lead me to a place where every day's the same
And I'm always falling more in love with you

Willie Nelson,I'm My Own Grandpa,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/immyowngrandpa.html,"

Now; many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be

This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed

This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
'Cause she was my father's wife

To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy

My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad

For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who; of course; was my step-mother

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son

My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because; she is my wife
She's my grandmother too

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Now; if my wife is my grandmother
Then; I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild

For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

You’ve maybe seen a ghost

Has someone gotten to you baby
Now open your arms
Pick up your head
Open your eyes
So you can see
What happens next

You won’t believe
Just how good it can get
We’ll make a lover 
Out of you yet

The fog is so thick
I can’t see my hands
It got much worse
Soon as I got in
And I know you’re somewhere
Here in the water
It’s ten feet deep
And the river won’t stop
I’ll tell you what’s in it
When I make it across
You could make it too
If you let someone help you

But you gotta give in
And you gotta let go
Then you can begin
To come up slow
Like a desert rose

Take a deep breath
And hold it in tight
And put your face up
Right into the light
Can’t you feel that full moon
Shining down on you
Help is coming
From the great unknown
Just maybe not
When you needed it most
Cause’ I can see you already
Know that you’re leaving
But I wish you’d stay
And just let me in
Cause’ everything can change
But you gotta be ready
Cause’ you won’t know when

[Lead 2:]
I was lost; without a friend.
Then I met Jesus; and he took me in.
In all of your temptation; just keep the faith;
He's already planned; a way for you to escape!

[Chorus: Lead 1]
Alright Now (Said I know I'll make it)
Think I'll make it (Anyhow)
(It's gonna be)
Alright Now (Said I think I'll make it)
Think I'll make it (Anyhow)

[Bridge:]
[Lead 1:]
I'm gonna make it
Yes I will
Ummm Ooooh
I'll make it
Won't let trials hold me down
True victory; I've found (Leads 1 and 2)
[Lead 2: (Lead 1)]
Said I'm gonna make it (Said I'm gonna make it)
I'll make it (I'll make it)
Said I will; will (Said I will; will)
I'm gonna make it (Gonna make it)
Get out of my way (Get out of my way)
I'm on a mission (I'm on a mission)
I'm on purpose (I'm on purpose)
With my vision (With my vision)

Haters can't stand you (Can't stand you)
Happy when you fall (Pray you fall)
But they don't know (But they don't know)
You can make it when you called
Everything's gone be

Alright Now [Choir]
Think I'll make it
Think I'll make it [Choir]
Anyhow
Anyhow [Choir]

Willie Nelson,Maria (Shut Up And Kiss Me),2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/mariashutupandkissme.html,"

That's my favorite part
Rewind my life on
When my world got dark 
You turned my light on
I watched it for hours again and again in my head
I did
I see I was down on you more than I needed to be
I'd say I'm sorry but then you'd think I'm lyin'

Maria; shut up and kiss me
Stop shakin'; stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me; believe me

Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carryin' on

That's my favorite shirt
You always had on
And it sure looked good
Every time you walked on
You're takin' the wind from me every chance that you could
You're good
Somethin' I can't explain
You tell me lately I've changed
If you feel better; tell me why are you cryin'?

Maria; shut up and kiss me
Stop shakin'; stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me; believe me

Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carryin' on

Maria; Maria can we talk it over instead?
Let's call it even and leave it alone
Come to bed

Maria; stop leavin' your teasin' is beaten me down
Maria; just calm down
In these situations I've found 
It's best not to be proud
And say that you're sorry

Maria; shut up and kiss me
Stop shakin'; stand up and hold me
I bet you're gonna miss me
You need me; believe me

Maria shut up and kiss me
You're crazy and it turns me on and on
The way you're carryin' on

And it turns me on and on 
on and on
on and on
And it turns me on and on
on and on 
on and on
on and on and on and on

Come on; come on
Yo; ye-yeah; ye-yeah
Where Ya At? Where Ya At?
Takin' it back to 1982
Runnin' Brownsville as we bring you (Where Ya At?
Where Ya At?)
That phat old school shit
The best of the troup could find
BOODOODOODOODOO!
Yo yo

[Chorus: Force MD's]
My crew is super duper fly and we came to get pai-aid
We pack those glocks and razor blades; duckin' spa-a-a-ades
Rollin' that sticky chocolate thai; we 'bout to get bla-a-azed
Y'all cats can't play with us; it's not a ga-a-a-a-ame

[Chorus: last two lines]

[RZA:]
Roll up the Winchester; pull my whites; that's the poindexter
Tell him bring back the black iron Mac strapped with two extra
Clips was a natural; worms in the Big Apple
Potholes in the street crack the Benz axle
Well let me come and descend my mens at you
You can't just catch this fish Jack mackarel
B-O-B boy; fast like Bruce Lee-roy
Caramel sundae honey set the decoy
For you soldiers seekin' to de-stroy
me; what the fuck you think we got the heat for?
You dunns; we knock out your gold fronts
Shorty got bigger and strong once she start smokin' blunts
With beef they get found in Hunt's
There's no chance to score; your best bet's to punt

I know R&B niggaz that's harder than you
Young T.G.'s with more street smarts than you
Hit liq'; shit you ain't got the heart to do
And I bet the click you run with they bustas too
Fuck a pass; we come strapped when we passin' through
All types of straps; you get clapped just for actin' new
Collectin' more guns ever since my cash done grew
Bad ass with no dash so I'm a bastard too
Ask your crew; nigga; I gay-bash 'em too
Grab his strap then ski-mask and bash 'em too

[Madam Scheez:]
West Cost rider; credit card slider
Roll up the windows and pass the lighter
I done turned into a lover; used to be a fighter
Now I pull out my guns and take 'em out one by one
You're a beautiful bitch; sittin' on pins and needles
I done seen bitches emotions breakin' up like The Beatles
Who's the real bitch now? Seen the fear in yo' tears
Now Tyrone folks is talkin'; shut the fuck up here
A product of my environment until my retirement
Have a habit of the automatic breakin' up the static
And if y'all niggaz wanna trip y'all can suck my dick
I got eight or nine of 'em; different colors and shit

[Timbo King:]
Smell like the rain forest; got diamonds in the hood - flawless
Sable Taurus; spit a verse; no chorus
You're on the wrong turf; one of my songs worth
two mil'; eh-yo; red pill; blue pill
Still stay focused; off-white lotus; brokers
I'ma dead y'all slot time; no spins on the hot nine
Eh-yo; my hot nine got my whole block sign
I rhyme gangsta; pops was an O.G.
I'm a junior; my son'll be the third
Let 'em learn degrees; the bees and the birds (uh-huh)
Let 'em learn degrees; the bees and the birds

[Shyheim:]
Why you actin' cuckoo like you just flew over nest?
Like I give a fuck how much weight you bench
Shyheim; my government and my attributes
BIG left me the Tec and the nine at my crib; so Gimme the Loot
Or L.B.C. ya like Snoop; I'm out to get coof; again coof
Turn up the thermostat; peep the murder rap
'Bout to bring it back; in the name of crack
In the name of dope
Ridin' through the hood in the Diamondback with spokes
In the name of thai; cliches and skunk
I came to get high; came to get drunk
I came with the Tec; Bobby came with the pump
We left with the shines; left with two dimes
Sittin' on dubs; royal flush; five of a kind
Countin' the spare for the deuce-ooh-ooh-one
Nigga; our year; niggaz; our year

[Freemurder:]
Yeah; yeah; yeah
Yo; talkin' all drunk; makin' a rap right here
Fool remainders; like he can't get clapped right here
Fuck the walkin'; Freemurder pack right here
On some napalm and bamboo track right there
Fuck twenty-five; shit; I'm strapped to the chair
Cuffie Crime Fam'; my fifth black in the air
Y'all don't want none; lead ya back down the stairs
Once the Mac appear
Four heat; I ain't hit 'im; shoot back fire wit 'im
Whole empire wit 'im; never plea guilty; I ain't hit 'im
Guess who lyin' wit 'im
Left po'; ya dead broke like Holy's ear when Tyson bit 'im
Still on point like lime segment
Pull out joints; the nine wet men
Double action; don't want no trouble; askin'

She smiles at him; he says; ""Hello""
They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance 
He asks her if she'd like a drink
She says; ""I better not I think
Oh; what the heck; maybe just one glass""

They talk about; oh; this and that
He says; ""I like the way you laugh
And I'm so really glad you're here""

Then suddenly it's much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

The night goes on; the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers' song that's meant for only two

And they don't even know it yet 
But this is one they'll not forget
The holiday where all their dreams came true

Across the floor he spins her 'round
Oh; could it be they've finally found
A love worth waiting for

Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

Then suddenly the night is gone
It's late into an early morn
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

Cos no-one can put up with me
And your mom don't like me either

Still bouncing round inside your head

I'm not the brightest crayon in the box
Everyone says I'm dumber than a bag of rocks
I barely even know how to put on my own pants
But I'm a genius in France (yeah); genius in France; genius in France

Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka

I may not be the sharpest hunk of cheese
I got a negative number on my SATs
I'm not good looking and I don't know how to dance
But nevertheless and in spite of the evidence I am still widely considered to be
A genius in France; a genius in France; a genius in France

People say I'm a geek; a moronic little freak
An annoying pipsqueak with an unfortunate physique
If I was any dumber; they'd have to water me twice a week

But when the Mademoiselles see me; they all swoon and shriek
They dig my mystique; they say I'm c'est magnifique
When I'm in Par-ee; I'm the chic-est of the chic

They love my body odor and my bad toupee
They love my stripey shirt and my stupid beret
And when I'm sipping on a Perrier
In some cafe town in St. Tropez

It's hard to keep the fans at bay
They say; ""Sign my poodle; s'il vous plait""
""Sign my poodle; s'il vous plait""

Hemenene humenene
himenene homenene
Poodle... poodle...

Folks in my hometown think I'm a fool
Got too much chlorine in my gene pool

A few peas short of a casserole
A few buttons missing on my remote control
A few fries short of a happy meal
I couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel

Instructions on the heel
Instructions on the heel

But when I'm in Provence; I get free croissants
Yeah; I'm the guy every French lady wants
And if you ask 'em why; you're bound to get this response
(He's a genius in France! Genius in France!)

That's right
(He's a genius in France; genius in France)
You know it
(He's a genius in France; genius in France; genius in France)

I'm not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree
But the folks in France; they don't seem to agree
They say; ""Bonjour; Monsieur would you take ze picture with me?""

I say; ""Oui; oui""
That's right; I say; ""Oui; oui""
""Oui; oui""
He says; ""Oui; oui""

I'm dumber than a box of hair
But those Frenchies don't seem to care
Don't know why; mon frere
But they love me there

I'm a genius in France
Yeah; I'm a genius in France

Gonna make a big splash when I show up in Cannes
Gonna make those Frenchies scream
""You ze man! You ze man! You ze man!""

But by some twist of fate; all the Frogs think I'm great
Oh; the men all faint and the women scream
They like me more than heavy cream

When I'm in Versailles; I'm a popular guy
My oh my; I'm as French as apple pie (apple pie)
They think I'm awful witty; a riot and a half
When I tell a stupid joke; they laugh(haw haw haw haw haw)
And laugh (haw haw haw haw haw haw)

People in France have lots of attitude
They're snotty and rude; they like disgusting food
But when they see me; they just come unglued
They think that I am one happening dude

Bowm ba ba bowm ba bowm ba bowm
I'm about as sharp as a bowling ball
But they like me better than Charles de Gaulle

Entre nous; it's very true
The room temperature's higher than my IQ
But they love me more than Gerard Depardieu
How did this happen; I don't have a clue

Well; I'm not the quickest tractor on the farm
I don't have any skills or grace or charm
And most people look at me like I'm all covered with ants
But I'm a genius in France (yeah); genius in France; genius in France

And I'm never goin' back; I'm never goin' back
I'm never never never never goin' back home again
I'm tearin' up my return flight ticket
Gonna tell the folks back here where they can stick it

'Cause I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back

The girls back home never gave me a chance
But I sho' 'nuff got them Frogs in some kinda trance
And I'm aware that it's a most improbable circumstance
But ""Great Googily Moogily""; I'm a genius in France

Every Frenchie that I meet
Just can't wait to kiss my feet
Get in line; pucker up! Tout Suite!

Bowm diddy bowm diddy bowm diddy

I'm gettin' even more famous by the hour
I'm stuffed with pastries and drunk with power
Now they're puttin' up my statue by the Eiffel Tower

A little more to the left; boys; a little more to the left
A little more to the left; boys; a little more to the left

I'm the biggest dork there is alive
My mom picked out my clothes for me 'till I was 35
And I forgot to mention
I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek convention

But the Frenchies think
That my poop don't stink
I'm a genius in France

Say; would you pass the Grey Poupon?

Who's to say this time I've wasted someday won't get used?
Maybe if you come around I'll start to get enthused

Who's to say?

Who's to say that I'm obsessed with everything you do
Just because it seems my schedule seems to shadow you?
Who's to say that tired cliché; ""There's more fish in the sea""?
I don't mind treading water 'cause you're the one for me

You say that by now I should know you'll never love me
But who's to say that what has never been will never be?
What has been will never be

Who's to say in time I wouldn't learn how to relax?
You'd forget about my clammy hands and my nervous laugh
Who's to say the way you look at him is truly love?
Maybe they should realize I fit you like a glove

You say that by now I should know you'll never love me
But who's to say that what has never been will never be?

We just came here to party (yea yea)
Don't make me (OOH!) somebody
Ladies getcha money and fellas getcha dough; let's go!

I guess it's safe to say I feel I'm due for recognition
Came a long way from flippin birds in the kitchen
All he want is money and a whole lot of women
Sixty million cash; broads ass-naked swimmin
Been in the win to the end since the beginnin
2000 fold back chronic cigarettes sittin on linen
And I'm leeeean-in; Flii's the man
My whip navigation's kit; I don't use my hands
Now let's dance; that's for all my Knight Rider fans
Need help? Filly sekkle; my car drives itself
I mastered metaphor 'til it was mathematics
Turn to them oohs to kill a boost sporadic
My vocals'll choke you like you actually asthmatic
Script writing'll flip like it's acrobatic
After I'll rat-tat-tat it out the blab-blabberbox; don't trip
My force is centrifugal without Masta Ace's whip

A Popeye's opened and I throw up the West Side (West Siiiide!)
Now let's slide y'all; we got bank to get
We the Strong Arm Steady Gang; steady man with nothin
But them gangster hits; fresh coast influence
We keep it movin in the party like let's do it
When my clique walks past the door
Dude; it's somethin like a fashion show
Ask ya folks if age got respect in the streets
Up in the club who woulda thought it was my record release
Necklace and piece; girl you sittin next to a beast
And if I whisper in your ear; you know my message is deep
Cause I'm a Super Mack; Big Daddy age without the Scoob and Scrap
Call me the janitor; I come through scoopin rats
Will.i.am; keep comin with them stupid tracks
We blow budgets like whatever; just recoup it back
Out for the scratch; a house in the black
A yacht and a 'Lac; keep crowds wavin like a stocking cap
Think you stoppin that? Nah; not even hardly
But we ain't come to lump you up; we just came to party

Don't you act kamikaze (no no)
We just came here to party (yea yea)
Don't make me (OOH!) somebody
Ladies getcha money and fellas getcha dough; let's go!

Krondon tannenbaum; stunt when the camera's on
Blunt full of Vietnan; Benz on the autobahn
Royalties takin long; anyway I take it on
Will make the beats; make the beats; make the beats
Hittin like Sonny Liston... renegade
Cadillac sixteen streets down your alleyway
Your crew tryin to do me like Jam-Master Jay
But; y'all ain't about ya bih'ness and I can tell
Then to warm my vocal chords will clog your senses

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy
So we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun
And it was 1981

We named him 'Baby'
He had a toothache
He started crying
It sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long
Because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll
And stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family
And we're alright now
We got money and a little place
To fight now
We don't know you
And we don't owe you
But if you see us around
I got something else to show you

Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy?
Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm
But there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had opinions
That didn't matter
I had a brain
That felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard
With nothing in it
Except a stick
A dog
And a box with something in it

The hardest button to button [x12]

Jimmy Wayne,You're The One I'm Talking To,2003,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimmywayne/youretheoneimtalkingto.html,"

I ain't the best; i ain't the worst
Won't be the last; sure ain't the first
Man who ever had a dream that finally got a break
So don't take this wrong i know i'm blessed
But what you see is what you get
My own interpretation of what's missing most these days
Identity; a real point of view
A little honesty; things we all could use

[Chorus:]
I don't think the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
In fact i think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true
I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired
Saying cool is in and good is out
I bet i've got your attention now and oh if i don't then
You're the one i'm talking to
You're the one i'm talking to

I'm tired of seeing youthful eyes
Growing up desensitized
By what they're seeing on TV; believing that's reality
That sex is love and life's a game
Where all the winners look the same
Designer jeans; expensive shoes; imported cars and attitudes
What happened to individuality
The right to choose your destiny?

[Chorus:]
I don't think the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
In fact i think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true
I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired
Saying cool is in and good is out
I bet i've got your attention now and oh if i don't then
You're the one i'm talking to
You're the one i'm talking to

I don't believe the world's all bad 
That life is cheap and love don't last
That cool is in and good is out
Have i got your attention now?
'cause if i don't then 
You're the one i'm talking to 
You're the one i'm talking to

Six days have I laboured hard
Finding help out of no man's hand
All night as my body aches
Rest my heart 'til the morning breaks

Souls are waking the world
Is awaiting Domingo morning
Rest in the Sanctuary Six
Day'll pass 'til Domingo morning

Fortune you have shone on me
I found a place where I can be free
Beauty lying in your eyes
Seventh day we will realize

Souls are waking the world
Is awaiting Domingo morning
Rest in the Sanctuary Six
Day'll pass 'til Domingo morning

Work hard to help me be
Take my opportunity
Moonlight will just pass by me
Domingo

Work hard just to help me be
Hours go by with reality
Hungry just to help me see
Where I get my immunity

Souls are waking the world
Is awaiting Domingo morning
Rest in the Sanctuary Six
Day'll pass 'til Domingo morning

The angels got together and decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

Follow you all around

Witchcraft,Her Sisters They Were Weak,2004,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/witchcraft/hersisterstheywereweak.html,"

There once was a king 
Who lived a palace uphill 
He had three wonderful daughters 
They had no free will 

The king sold his soul 
To the devil yes indeed 
In return he was promised 
Wealth and life eternally 

The devil came riding one day 
Upon his blackened horse 
The princesses was his aim 
They were destined to run his course 

One of the girls were tall 
More beautiful than blue skies 
Her hair was colored bright 
And she had white marble eyes 

She will die 

(Her sisters they were weak 
They fell for the devil's charms 
Mesmerizing eyes 
They went right into his arms 
Afraid to look around 
The bright girl ran away 
One last glance 
And she saw her sisters pray) 

The king he sat alone 
And listened to the sound 
He rest upon his throne 
While the palace sank underground

Whatever happened to all that love?
How come enough is now not enough?

Tell me when I began to annoy you?
And will someone else get the blame after I do?

Eager to leave 'er
You try to please her
Now you're on your back
Like a golden retriever
Eager to leave 'er
You try to reach her
But she beats your hand
Like a Blackjack dealer

How long since I've been fascinating?
Since the grass was green and the bed was shaking?

Did we change too much or too much need changing?
Or maybe all guys could do with a little re-arranging

Eager to leave 'er
You try to please her
Now you're on your back
Like a golden retriever
Eager to leave 'er
You try to reach her

Now you're on your back
Like a golden retriever
Eager to leave 'er
You try to reach her
But she beats your hand
Like a Blackjack dealer

Eager to leave 'er
Eager to leave 'er

When did the kindness turn into a weakness?
Who left the gaps in the conversation?
Is it ambition that creates competition?
Wasn't it you that saw the true impression?
Why do I have to ignore you to get your attention?
Ever get the feeling you just can't give in?
Rather both of us die than one of us win
If it happens again; you gonna blame him?
What if it's really as good as it gets?
How does it feel if you live with regret?
What if the best times just haven't been yet?
We're all holding onto a bet

Eager to leave 'er
You try to please her
Now you're on your back
Like a golden retriever
Eager to leave 'er
You try to reach her
But she beats your hand
Like a Blackjack dealer
Eager to leave 'er
You try to please her
Now you're on your back
Like a golden retriever
Eager to leave 'er
You try to reach her
But she beats your hand
Like a Blackjack dealer

Eager to leave 'er
Eager to leave 'er
Eager to leave 'er

I break bread so they wanna suspect me

to stay up on top; your game so close to the pavement
time brings change in mind

All the secrets that I hold
Will be yours to share for always; always

A gentle breeze touches my skin

And I know you’re with me always; always
I can feel it in the air
The fire that we share
Can only come from deep within
It’s a light that burns so bright
It guides you through the night
And leads you to me
So find your way back and 

Hold me; touch me
Let the love come rushing through me
I’m yours with every breath I take
Forever and ever
Hold on to love
Cause deep down that’s what we’re made of
Never let go for my heart’s sake
Cause my heart belongs to you

I lie awake to hear you breathe
Only you can fill the need 
That builds and burns so deep inside me; inside me

As the moon lights up the sky
There’s a thousand reasons why
That my heart will only beat for you

[RINGMASTER]
Then a priest from some denomination
Witnessing this abomination
Blesses not the bird but the beast
The Unknown Soldier appears on the field
And takes the bird's feathers to put on his shield
Then a powerful judge from the high court
Decrees that the birds really ought
Not be allowed to sing in the trees
But then one day
Some of the priests and soldiers and judges
Putting aside some old worn grudges
Changes their minds and the birds sang again
It was the Revolution
The Revolution is a story of birds
Of sticks and stones and bushes and bones

[RINGMASTER & CHORUS]
A story of now; a story of then
A story of woman; a story of men

[RINGMASTER]
A story of everything to come
Of everything under the sun

Westlife,Desperado,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/westlife/desperado.html,"

Desperado; why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh; you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your 
best bet

Now it seems to me; some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado; oh; you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger; they're drivin' you 
home
And freedom; oh freedom well; that's just some 
people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado; why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences; open the gate
It may be rainin'; but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let sombody love you)
You better let somebody love you
before it's too late

Satisfied of course; sure I had it all
Very busy living my dreams; visions large and small
Until you said hello; and life began to change
It's funny how you fit into my world; it's wonderful and strange

Suddenly it's safe to let go and keep falling
Maybe answered prayers look a lot like you; I think maybe so
Talk about surprise; how was I to know
Love called out my name when you said hello

Suddenly it's safe to let you and keep falling
Maybe answered prayers look a lot like you; I think maybe so
Talk about surprise; how was I to know
Love called out my name when you said hello

[Shirley Bassey:]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

[Kanye West & Shirley Bassey:]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Kanye West:]
Good mornin'; this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands; legs; arms; for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella; my home
My chain; these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they; Jacob? Don't lie to me; man
See; a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade; we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds; the chains; the bracelets; the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby; it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight; 'cause

[Kanye West & Shirley Bassey:]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?
Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)

[Kanye West:]
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question; dawg; ""Yo; where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
""What's up with you and Jay; man? Are y'all OK; man?""

[Jay-Z:]
Yup; I got it from here; 'Ye; damn
The chain remains; the gang is intact
The name is mine; I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on; but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Ha ha; pardon me; I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order; this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day; impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke; I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman; I'm a business; man!
Let me handle my business; damn
Kanyeez you got me; Freeway then Foxy
YG's; Teairra Mari; Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah; he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear
Sayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever; I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
(I'm Young; bitches!) Good night!

[Wax:]
Cats try to pigeonhole my written flow but didn't know
My spittin' so orginal that it cannot be bitten or forgotten
Hip Hop's Johnny Rotten
Got the bed that your mommy got in
Suicidal kamikaze plotting your murder story in purgatory
The burning glory of my weeds unmatched indeed
Locked to the brain and got latched and keyed
Back from the dead with hot tracks you need
You spot Wax's steeze on the top of the trees
It's hogging up all of the shine from these other emcees
The people in my neighborhood can't get their water to freeze
Because my presence got their fridges at a hundred degrees
I be the; conductor that done fucked your; whole shit up
Like Hiroshima go get a fork; to stick in the litter box and eat shit
Dunny cause I'm sicker than chicken pox; and spittin' the shit that rocks
And sticking my dick in foxy women
They like how I fuck to the rhythm
They be like
Holy shit the flow he spit was both classic and fat like moby dick
I'm totally sick; my whole clique globally thick
Ride the microphone and we rip; any opponent we pick
They like
Jesus Christ the steeze is nice
It's both dark and powerful like Condoleeza Rice
Emcees get diced; chopped up to pieces with mics
Then I add a little spit for some season and spice
And saute it for twenty minutes then I eat it with rice
And that's Wax's forte dish; classic gourmet bitch
I'mma rock 'til the wheels fall off
Fuck that; I'mma rock 'til you ears fall off
I used to rock so easily
Back in the days of Run DMC
When they was like
Dum diddy dum diddy diddy dum dum
I said one fifty one rum in the city slum
I'm a gritty bum
Yes; a B-More all-star
Natty Boh' with the hole in the wall ball
Pass the henny and I'm so damn good
How a suburban white boy spit so damn hood
I'm just saying bruh
The flow so gutta y'all
We throw strikes while y'all throw those gutter balls
That's why the ho so butterball
Got your girl all up in the lab rocking no clothes but her bra
Yes; and the flow don't stop
You should photoshop my face on a robocop
I'm so hot robotic rhyme
I ain't gotta sign on the dotted line
To prove that your shit ain't as hot as mine
Bottom line is that we are the truth
You need proof; witness me and Herbal T in the booth
We just bouncing; and stretching
And it's oh so ear and eye catching
Not to mention the fact that we never come whack
It's just a motherfucking family tradition

[Herbal T:]
Yes it's true bro
Few flow; better than the veteran duo
Compare us to H2O
People saying ""where did you move yo?""
From the east to the wild wild west like Kool Moe
Dee; Herbal T be breaking you down; making you bow
To the kings of this motherfucker taking the crown
Gimme a; rake and a plow and a couple of seeds
In a couple of months; we gon' roll a couple of trees
And get; high as shit the fliest clique
Is both independent and slick like a private dick
Straight pillaging your village in a pirate ship
Them guys is sick; make you catch a virus quick 'til you hu-
Lucinate them dudes is great
They both on top and legendary like Medusa's snakes
And like her; I'll turn you stone with one line
Literally make you rock to the way that I rhyme
It's like; steadily gettin' incredibly spittin'
Whenever we hittin' the studio we never be slippin'
Cleverly written material; readily sippin' Imperial
Stout; by Samuel Smith; the man the myth; the legend is me
Herbal God damn T
Shining a God damn light so everybody can see
You the phoniest punk; spittin' erroneous junk
While I create melodies like Thelonious Monk
Only a skunk could compare to the funk of the flow when I'm spittin'
Hit you quick then like I'm dunking a donut I'm dippin'
Straight flip with the manuscript
To make your whole fucking clique just abandon ship
Like Geronimo; toppling you like a domino
Treat emcees like detainees at Guantanamo
Torture 'em interrogate 'em
Force 'em in the barricade
And cover 'em in gas and then I scorch 'em when I serenade 'em
Pour a little marinade on top of the steaks
While DJ's keep my records all on top of the crates
Stopping the fakes
Girls on the dance floor say
""Yo Herbal what's the T stand for?""
Well
The textbook talented track terrorist tomahawk
Type of technique to teach tricks to Tony Hawk
Trash talkers try to test the technology
Tempted to traverse toxic topography
I'm trouble; like treacherous trails
The torpedo taking out twinkled-toed tattle tales
Two takes max when I tape tracks
Tricks tactics is tiny like tic-tacs
Torrential like tornadoes and twisters
I transmit transcripts through my transistor
Trap tricks like toads in terrariums
The tip-top terminator totalitarian

I wanna big up one of my bredrins like
Man must've linked up like in a snooker hall

The profit margin it went up like a rocket
Olders try to clap they want [?]
I'll give up give in and feel they've got to stop it
Me I keep riding; I'm on a ban but I can't stop driving
I ain't hiding; I just wanna be well prepared for the day we start fighting
See me with a couple showerman you'll run like
I had to run for my life
I was swinging against bare man in the club
Didn't realise I was getting stabbed with a knife
And now I'm like I'm still alive
See I keep on going like a showerman would
See me at any shoobs where the girls look good
And their mums cook good
And their aunts look good
I can sense beef cause I roll deep in the hood

You can't keep me out the street maybe
Cause I roam around the street daily
Why? Do you roam the street daily
Guess that just the way the street raised me

You can't keep me out the street maybe
Cause I roam around the street daily
Why? Do you roam the street daily
Guess that just the way the street raised me

Since I was young I learned something
Look into your enemy; what's the beef over - nothing
If I had a reason to smash your head into the wall
I would do it so you're just bluffing
Seen if I'm real let me show you
I don't wanna be a street killer but
Slipping on road at any time then you will be the one ducking
Running for the Docklands; hit the tracks
You just missed it I saw the door shutting
Beefs on - got him
When I'm looking down I see it won't stop here
I see the whole lot here; my spirit is flowing
Leeside; eastside; so many artists on the trees growing
Told you before that I ain't tiptoeing
Just land from a holiday; red skin glowing
Mastered the game better than Micheal Owen without them knowing

You can't keep me out the street maybe
Cause I roam around the street daily
Why? Do you roam the street daily
Guess that just the way the street raised me

You can't keep me out the street maybe
Cause I roam around the street daily
Why? Do you roam the street daily
Guess that just the way the street raised me

You can't keep me out the street maybe
Cause I roam around the street daily
Why? Do you roam the street daily
Guess that just the way the street raised me

All alone and there ain't no way out
Paying for the things I've done

Going fishing after church
Lover her so much it hurts
And Crying now and then

Laying down for a good nights sleep
Making love so soft and sweet

I might call Kylea for this one
It's likely; we might be swinging 'til nightfall
I'm a straight winner; don't need to be spiteful
Fully grown boy; I'm not like you
But if I have to; I'ma start bussing like Mike
If you know I'm in a bad mood; run for your life
Don't; hype with the knife; come sly with the [?]
Come along boom-boom; riding my bike
I swear Josh that's what I'm like
'Cause I've had a hard life
Watch the news; life ain't shite
Then I see you angry; fighting the mic
I'm like; what's your problem with the mic
Then I remember

I was at your stage; six years back
Had a strap in the back of the car six years back
So what could you teach me
I learnt the lessons you're learning today about six years back
I'm like six years
Yeah; that's a very long time
Can you imagine what I've learnt
In fact; it's baited from my life; I'll burn your whole camp
You wouldn't be shit without six years back

And it's not a long ting when you come and battle me
And you couldn't hassle me
The intelligence won't ever baffle me
You're a shambles rudeboy; scramble
It's not your day but still give it a try
And we'll give 'em a reply
Still gotta decide; if I wanna be horrible; give 'em pressure they can't handle
It's not even a clash at the moment
But I've got a couple new flows they're potent
MC's wear away like erosion
It's not your time; the block that's mine
Do what I done blud; I clocked that grime
Got power; get back to peaking one hour of practice
Irony had this open up
That's why you get a look in; or even a booking
Don't mess about; I got the blue beats cooking
My bars are too deep so you won't get a footing
And you can't put in what I put in
You're a sheep; make foot steps
Never know when I ain't gonna creep
I can't tell you when I had a good sleep
But I'm looking at the game and I've still got a look in

Got no strings but I think with my dingalingaling
Two two for the two ting tong ting two stonking
Two's two
Looks luking
Fruits fruiting
Sleuths sleuthing
Got no strings I think with my dingalingaling
Root root for the rooting
Toot toot for the tooting

(I love my Mum and I love my Dad
They never have any love I've had
So much love it's driving me mad)

Blood clotter
Slender tone
Say tres bon
Like a dingadingdongadongadong
Sound of the town
Gets a little louder
He saw and I saw my saw mine
If you're in this club and you hear this sound
Come on everybody boogie down boogie down

Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
No feeling in your heart
Running in the fast lane
Speeding in the dark
Trying to maintain
No feeling in your heart

Ween,Friends,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ween/friends.html,"

I dreamt of a move 
A great move 
To another place with much more land 
I was driven by car 
And woke before I got there 
I remember the place and it was beautiful 

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is; talking with a friend. 
As friends we were always so close but so far away... 
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend? 
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for. 

There was more for me 
It would be more open 
Scary to think that I could be happy 
She'd said it was the same road 
But up more; alot more 
Just be patient and we'll get there 

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is; talking with a friend. 
As friends we were always so close but so far away... 
Friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend? 
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for. 

I never got there 
But the morning brings light 
And so; I'll keep on looking.

I'm dying to catch my breath
Oh why don't I ever learn?
I've lost all my trust;
though I've surely tried to turn it around

Can you still see the heart of me?
All my agony fades away
when you hold me in your embrace

Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear me down
You've opened the door now; don't let it close

I'm here on the edge again
I wish I could let it go
I know that I'm only one step away
from turning it around

Can you still see the heart of me?
All my agony fades away
when you hold me in your embrace

Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe

Don't tear it down; what's left of me
Make my heart a better place

I tried many times but nothing was real
Make it fade away; don't break me down
I want to believe that this is for real
Save me from my fear
Don't tear me down

Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place

Give me something I can believe
Don't tear it down; what's left of me

[Chorus: W.C.]
If you was born in the '80s then I'm probably your papa
Cause 9 times out of 10 I fucked your mama
9 times out of 10 she gave me drama
But; fuck that shit; I'm all about the dollar

[Ice Cube:]
When you see me in the streets you can call me daddy
When you go see your mama know I hit that fatty
Back in the day; before she got ratty
I; had her ass in the back of my Caddy
And; you know I done it; I'ma keep it 100
Back when she had more ass than stomach
Back; before her looks started to plummet
She would call me everynight; beggin' she want it
I would go pick her up; then dick her up
Then stick her up; for some gas bucks
For some lunch money; and some fast food
Nigga was a pimp before a Nigga With a Attitude
And when you picture that I know you wanna get your gat
Understand atomic dog always get the cat
And if young motherfuckers ain't feelin' that
I wish she can open up; and put ya back

Disrespectful ass groupie new nigga
Can't do shit but shut the fuck up and salute me nigga
Lench Mob; Big Swang the chrome eight arms
Been doin' this since Magic was playin' at The Forum
When Boogie Down and Scott Laraque dropped
I was at the Raising Hell Tour fuckin' your mama in the parking lot
When LL was rockin' the bells; before Cardia and Chanelle's
I was skeetin' on the Gazelle's; in slow motion
But only if a nigga knew she was havin' you
I would have made the bitch get an abortion

I've met someone that makes me feel seasick
Oh what a skill to have
Oh what a skill to have
So many skills that make her distinctive
But they're not mine to have
No they're not mine

Whenever she looks i read the nearest paper
Though i don't care about the soaps
No i don't care about the soaps
Though i'm acting like i'm in an Eastenders episode

If this is a rom-com 
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director please

Carrots help us see much better in the dark
Don't talk to girls; they'll break your heart
And this is my head and this is my spout
*But* they work together; they can't figure anything out

So with the angst of a teenage band
Here's another song about a gender i'll never understand
Here's another song about a gender i'll never understand

If this is a rom-com
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director
If this is a rom-com
Kill the director please

All day long I sit home
Channel surfing alone
Waiting for your unexpected
Visit through my window
You take me and undress me
Educate and test me
Breathless and bewildered
Then like magic you're gone

It doesn't really matter
When you come or where you go
And it doesn't really matter
I really don't want to know
Cause you're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me

Its 3 a.m. I wake up
I get myself all dressed up
I wait for you to kiss and burn me
Melt off all my make-up
Your crazy thoughts are unkind
But in the back of my mind
I think that you would love me; need me
Its just a waste of my time

And it doesn't really matter
When you come or where you go
And it doesn't really matter
I really don't want to know
Cause you're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me

And maybe its what I deserve
For all the times that I've
Hurt; and burned; and toyed
And played with your heart
Look at me caving in
You win...
Oh; you're the only thing
You're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back through my window and bother me
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back and hot and bother me

Or trys to portray that they're anything other than grime
If they are grime
Dunknow; its not long
Representing grime all day; E3
Straight to the end of time; I'm so grime so grime

I write bars on Spiderman's rooftop
Plagued in my system; flow long distance
Spray til my times up; look now spitters in the game wanna climb up
Keep on climbing; I'll keep on striving
Speaking about my life and what I did
Made a new tune on my laptop
Found a new rave sound tune called hybrid
I weren't a shy kid but I had the heart of a black star night kid
Black stars rise up
Stop chatting shit everybody better wise up
Analyse why me and my race don't ever wanna smile up
[?] any other challengers
Don't give a damn cause he's not a badman til he's '02 liner

Back to the roads; nuff crime no evidence
Magazines quote me wrong I keep telling 'em
Fly to the office and wile out
Might get nicked so I wile out

Cause we don't care what the people say
And I was at the start when man weren't sure
And them man are gone but I'm here today
I'm rare today I've got nuff to say
Grime is my game
Fuck what you think you could never employ me
Or pay me a minimum wage
Make more money from haze

The time has come at last
For years we have followed the wake of his perilous rule
Serpent of deception you will fall to your knees
When this is all said and done
March my minions for I have freed you from your timeless chambers
I have been dying to see you die
Among all the witnesses to my last words
Your pitiful scheme will fail
You will fail again
If you only knew the harm I've caused
In my journey to cleanse you from this earth
Every first born child I have slaughtered and every virgin I have defiled
Even the blind have seen my blasphemies
The deaf hears my sacrilege
Halt! Fallen one I provoke thee
I created your existence
I can surely cease you of life
So kill yourself
Mindless fool
Your apprentice has expired
Banished to the netherworld from which I have spawned
Where is your sense of tyranny
You can't even keep up with your own kind
My name is scattered amongst those who have feared this day
I am not who you claim me to be
Do you know what you have done
This is what we've become
I sense your pathetic guilt
This is what we've become
How you under estimate the power of denial sickens me
And I reject any last apologies
This is the last time you hear my name
But forever I haunt your dreams of agony
You know my name

Come and ask one
But it's like; really; sitting in the top
Everybody wanna try and pull a fast one
So I step off the tops but once I'm advised from a legend
I wrote this bar at midnight 07; January first
I learnt to drive manually first
Me and my sound; we were angry first
If shots were getting buss
I'm like ""can we first?""
Used to like school but I kept getting kicked out
What about music? Bring a few hits out
I got it in my; mum died; brother too
Plus I don't wanna be the one who missed out

Winds Of Plague,Reloaded,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/windsofplague/reloaded.html,"

Tonight... the world is ours!

What the fuck is up motherfuckers?
This is Winds Of Plague and all that 2008 shit.

We've got the world in the palm of our hands.
Busters fall down when we're barking commands.
Atlas ain't got shit on our steez.
Kick out the chair and get on your knees.

We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.
Pray to your god when you're meeting your end.
Hope is dead; revelation begins.
We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.

Lift your head; look around can't you see; we were born into a world so bleak.
We claim this night still standing tall.
Casting shadows; you indulge concrete.

A call to arms; we'll bring the revolution.
A call to arms pillaging; annihilate man.

Going to take every word and shove it down your fucking throat.

Break down the walls; rebuild society.

We've got the world in the palm of our hands.
Busters fall down when we're barking commands.
Hope is dead; revelations begins.
We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.

Arise the sun is near.
Witness an uprising; see our strength.

Arise.

Tyrone Wells,More,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tyronewells/more.html,"

Sometimes I get so tired
I'm just trying to find a place to lay my head 
I look up to the sky
I feel the warmest light comfort me

I've seen the great heights
Reminding me I'm alive         
I don't want to die
I don't want to waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars; I feel it on the shore
I know there's something; I know there's something more

I think we're all afraid
That we might be alone; alone down here
We all want to have some faith
At least that's true in my case; to just believe

I've seen the great heights
Reminding me I'm alive         
I don't want to die
I don't want to waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars; I feel it on the shore
I know there's something

This world may crumble into the ocean
It could all end tonight
I undermine you then try to find you 
My only source of life
I'm breathing; I am breathing; I am alive 

I don't want to die
I don't want to waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars; I feel it on the shore
I know that I'm alive

I don't want to die
I don't want to waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars; I feel it on the shore
I know there's something more

All this I've tried to hide
All the things I felt inside

It was like a dream
in a dark and dreary scene
another lonely night
so much pain inside
'til there was You; mmm

Stood a little scared
with the notion that You're there
I was on the line
running out of time
I needed a change

And so it goes; oh oh
(You changed my world)
Gave You my soul; and You
(You changed my world)
Lost all control
(You changed my world)
So glad I know; I know; I know
(You changed my world); mmm

Lost in the cold
where there's nowhere else to go
it's like I'm on the run
racing for the sun
the night's so dark
(ooh; though the night's so dark; there's a trace of sunlight)

On the other side
I can see a sudden Light
it's breaking through the night
my heart begins to cry; mmm
the Light was You

And so it goes
(You changed my world)
Gave You my soul; ooh oh oh
(You changed my world)
Lost all control; mmm; mmm
(You changed my world)
So glad I know; mmm; mmm
(You changed my world)

Hey; hey
Now; I'm so deep in love
(Everything that I have I;owe it to You)
You gave me a reason to go on
('Cause You did for me things that no one else could do)
Now; I will tell the world
(That You gave me a love that will always be true)
And I will love You; forevermore

And so it goes; so it goes; and so it goes;ooh ooh ooh ooh
(You changed my world)
Gave You my soul; gave You my soul
(You changed my world); You came and changed my world
Lost all control; lost all control; yes; I did
(You changed my world)
So glad I know; so glad I know
So glad I know; I know; I know
Changed my world; changed my world
And so it goes; and so it goes
You changed my world; mmm mmm
Gave You my soul
You changed my world
Lost all control; I've lost control
You changed my world
I'm so glad I know; I know; I know
So glad I know
You changed my; changed my world
Hey!
And so it goes; and so it goes
You changed my world; You changed my world; ooh ooh ooh oh
Gave You my soul; You changed
Gave You my world; gave You my world
You changed my world
Picked me up; turned me around
I've lost control; You changed my world
I'm so glad You did
So glad; so glad I know

Some one to follow; someone to fear
Keeps me in line; keeps me in gear
But the hand that lashed out brought me to tears
That's why I am drinking up all of theses beers

The bar and the beer keeps me coming back to here
This drunken stupor is not what it seems
It helps me laugh; helps me dream

I had a fight with the woman so I stop in to think
I have my psychologist poor me drink
My head is clouded so it's plain to see
We'll work things out; the bottle and me

The bar and the beer keeps me coming back to here
This drunken stupor is not what it seems
It helps me laugh; helps me dream

Sat outside in the parking lot
All night long 'til the sun came up
Outside the diner where you used to work
Waiting for you to walk out; but you never did
No; you never did

I turned on the radio
Preacher man preaching about lettin' go
He said time can heal the broken soul
But I swear I don't kjnow if it ever will
If it ever will

God knows how hard I've tried
But I'm still holdin' on even though you're gone

So let the days turn to nights
Let the earth spin; let the years roll by
But I'll still be lovin' you
Let this road lead me on 'til the hurt is gone

But I won't forget you girl; even if I had
All the time in the world

I took a walk out in the rain
To clear my head and get some space
But in every drop I saw your face
You seem to follow me everywhere I go

Everywhere I go
Could be a thousand miles away
But there's no distance long enough
'Cause nothing's gonna change

So let the days turn to nights
Let the earth spin; let the years roll by
But I'll still be lovin' you
Let this road lead me on 'til the hurt is gone

But I won't forget you girl; even if I had
All the time in the world

All the time in the world
So let the days turn to nights
Let the earth spin; let the years roll by
But I'll still be lovin' you

So let the days turn to nights
Let the earth spin; let the years roll by

A yellow Post-It note on my steerin´ wheel
A penciled hard reminder of the way you feel
Just a passing thought but it made me see
It´s the little things that mean the world to me

Like your morning touch upon my skin
And your gentle kiss that wakes me up and does me in
You hold me close and it sets me free
It´s the little things that mean the world to me

[Chorus:]
How you´ve changed my life there are no words
You´re my Heaven you´re my Earth and you´re my universe
And when I add it up love´s bigger than we ever dreamed
With the little things that mean the world to me

(yeah)
Your love´s in the day to day way you show
Me the tiny miracles like the way you let me know
That up ahead we got something new
A little one that looks a lot like me and you
Tears fill my eyes as you kiss my cheek
It´s the little things that mean the world to me

How you´ve changed my life there are no words
You´re my Heaven you´re my Earth and you´re my universe
And when I add it up love´s bigger than we ever dreamed
With the little things that mean the world to me

It´s the little things that mean the world to me.

We Are The Emergency,Drop Me Off At The Bridge,2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wearetheemergency/dropmeoffatthebridge.html,"

(The fresh night air. The stinging scent of chlorine)
The stars they shine so bright. They cancel out the headlights.
(Ignore the signs; keep running faster; faster)
The moon it caught your eyes as you fell from the high rise.

I don't remember
The last time; time slowed down
Your breath held in the air;
Your eyes caught in my stare.
The glass it hangs
Like stars across the night sky.
The moon it falls;
And paints them red tonight.

(The sky is falling in; I reach for broken glass.)
The shatters dull the sounds; I don't hear your body crash
(And now I'm on the edge and I am looking down)
Sirens are growing stronger; I can't ignore the sounds

(Is this flying? Or is this feeling dying?)
Cool water on my skin; my chest is caving in
(Wind burns my face. Concrete is growing faster)
Its time accept your fate. Your screams are far too late

Please someone save me
Before this becomes of me
Please someone save me
Before this becomes of me

The shatters dull the sounds; I don't hear your body crash
(And now I'm on the edge and I am looking down)
Sirens are growing stronger; I can't ignore the sounds
(The sky is falling in; I reach for broken glass.)
The shatters dull the sounds; I don't hear your body crash

I was rolling in my car when I pulled up at the mall
Couldn't find a place to park; threw my keys to the valet
I was only there to hang; wasn't lookin' for a thing
I was just about to bounce and then I saw Miss. Lady
Then I said to myself

There goes my baby; there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me; there goes my baby
There goes my baby; she gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love; we gonna have some babies

She was coming out the shoe store
Pretty little thing; a couple of bags in her hand right in front of Macy's
And then I saw her at the food court
Sipping lemonade; conversating on her cell phone
Looking so amazing; and I said to myself

There goes my baby; there goes my destiny
Onliest one for me; there goes my baby
There goes my baby; she gon' be the one
We gon' fall in love; we gonna have some babies

She gon' wear my ring; she gon' take my name
Take her to the cookout; me and her gon' hang
Take her to my mama house; meet Smokey and them
If she need her hair done see my cousin Carol

I'll treat her like a queen; give her everything
She will be my girl till we old and gray
And I knew it from the moment
That I saw her lovely; lovely face

I can't think straight

There's crowds at the windows; but no way of knowing
Who they've got this time; and who's going next
She always leaves a letter; and signs off with an X

And I said I could never lie to you but you know I always do
Is it the same as before?

And miserys like a hearse; cos I know where you're going
The waves getting higher; and I'm tired of rowing
She whispers in my ear; sings the cold black song
Hold me a while longer; she won't be gone for long

And fetch the car girl; I think it's time we got out of here
No breaks into the night
And with sadness my mistress
And with God as my witness
Just drive till it gets light

When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed

Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadow's form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so

How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay

All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

UK; I'm the king of rap; and I quickly adapt
And I'll shoot at actors; Guy Richie of rap
I'm a rock and roller; with a revolver
Lock; stock and two smokin' barrels; I quickly re-snatched
The limelight; I made the Africans say they're proud
They used to say it before; but didn't say it loud
The Signature LP; I left so many speechless
They're like; what can I say? I tell em say it's out

[Wizzy Wow & Chip:]
Aye Mr. Munk; are you gonna be cool?
I'm like; you don't have to ask
My feature's the answer

[Verse 5 - Chip:]
Forget about violence; I'd rather be me
'Cuz you chased the money but the money chased me
And you chased the honies but the honies chased me
It's not a Catch 22 It's more try and catch me (If you can!)
And any feature I get; I kill it
They just spit lyrics; I vomit bullets
So be cool; don't act like you know me
Go and talk to my hand and the trophy

[Wizzy Wow & Wretch 32:]
Yo Wretchro boy; are you gonna be cool?
I'm like Mr Wizzy Wow; yeah; I'm gonna be cool

[Verse 6 - Wretch 32:]
I'm as cool as an ice cube; cooler than Ice Cube
You can see what I'm saying; iTunes
I'm the breeze; why you clear me in typhoons
You're just caught up in the air that I fly through
So unfortunately
I'm the only one guessing who's cooler than me
The hook speaks for itself; I'm as cool as the beat
What I do laying down you'd be calling your dreams

[Pre-Hook - Wretch 32]

[Hook - Wizzy Wow]

[Verse 7 - Wretch 32:]
Ah; and now I want my van shoes
I'm a Wretchroboy; I don't know about you
I got my iron on tee and I want my van shoes
We're the Wretchro boys and I got my hype; too
I got the King hat that match my black shoes
And the Spaceboy jacket; but I want my fans; too
Ah; I know; I know
Ah; cuh I know; I kna-ow
Ah; cuh I know; I know
I got my king hat and yeah I got my van shoes
And we're Wretchro boys; I don't know about you

Ey; ey ey ey ohhhhhh yea yeah yea yea
Watching the clock counting down the hours;
Waiting not even 24 has past but I cant take it
For your love I'm a addict cant break the habit
Some many call me pathetic if she ain't yours you wont get it 
Ready to climb the highest tower just to see if 
I can spot her face out in the crowed from the distance
When she not in my grasp my heart starts to panic
Got a case of the classic missing my baby badly

[Chorus]
Homesick; all because my baby not around
I'm homesick; even though we're in the same town
I'm homesick; seconds after me kiss
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I can't control this feeling 
Its like I'm homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Seconds after we kiss 
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I cant control this feeling
Its like I'm homesick

Feels like forever when its only been some minutes
Cause when we're together I just lose myself in it
Is it wrong to be childish when my baby allows it
Some may call me pathetic if she ain't yours; you wont get it
Don't for a second I'm being insecure
But when its so real; its a love you must adore
No I wont beat around it; its like I jumped now I'm drowning
In her presence; she's my life saving medicine

[Chorus]
Homesick; all because my baby not around
I'm homesick; even though we're in the same town
I'm homesick; seconds after me kiss
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I can't control this feeling 
Its like I'm homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Seconds after we kiss 
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I cant control this feeling
Its like I'm homesick

You been fishing now I'm hooked had the perfect bate
Took a bite it was so good wanted a second taste 
You're my favourite thing to do everyday I need a dose of you
I know you just left but I'm homesick

[Chorus]
Homesick; all because my baby not around
I'm homesick; even though we're in the same town
I'm homesick; seconds after me kiss
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I can't control this feeling 
Its like I'm homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Its like I'm homesick; homesick; homesick
Seconds after we kiss 
When you walk out the door I start to miss
I cant control this feeling
Its like I'm homesick

My mind is breakin'; can you feel the heat?
My boots are burning; when they hit the street

Good morning whiskey
Good morning night
The end of the world is in my sight

Coming out from the other side
If you know me you must have died

[Chorus]
Karmageddon
Karmageddon
Bringing Karmageddon on it's way

The world goes round
Too fast to see
The killing here
Well it gets waist deep

Good morning captain
The scout will say
The end of the world's gonna come today

I reach way back; with an Indian guide
The battle I saw; I must have died

Karma coming round like a raging flame
I look like Abel; but I'm raising Cain
War and money burning all the time
What's going down is coming round
Karmageddon's bound

Traveling back; on a spirit ride
It's going down; the captain cried

Wrapped and bound; they laid You down

But in three days; the stone was rolled away

Are you really here or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore

Yeah; is that really you success?
I know you're close...
But I haven't seen you in so fucking long man; you know
I'm a find you though; I'm gonna find you

Yeah; success; is that you around the corner?
I've been on your trail; now they say it warmer warmer
It's been a long time since I seen you too
Probably since my last wrestling match in high-school
And after that you left me; packed up and bounce with lady luck
Then shit got messy; grades started slippin' and the drugs kicked in
E pills; coke; percs; Klonopins
Either high or in a bad mood; pissed off teenager covered in tattoos
Grade A fuck-up; simple as that
I'm surprised my two parents didn't turn their back
But they never gave up on me; I love 'em for that
And I promise I'm a pay it all back with these raps
I know my bail was high but mom and dad I'm a pay back
Every penny or I'll try; let it rot

Are you really here or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore

Yeah; success; is that you?
People tell me that you're nearby and I'm hopin' that it's true
Cause lately you haven't made an appearance in my life
Just a spot at the bottom and a lot of long nights
Court fees; shity jobs; bad luck; drug problems
Or have a non-religious kid looking to God
Swear to God I been through a lot of shit on this path
I'm not here to brag about it but no one can change the past
I put together raps tryna make myself a stag with it
I've put my heart; soul; everything I had in this
Slice my wrists and I bleed for this rappin' shit
How could you motherfuckers say I'm not passionate?
This is all I've ever loved; do it till the death of me
Proven that I'm worthy; I don't care what they expect from me
And I'll do it till there's not a breath left in me
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Ah; tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Yeah

So many people tell me success was up for the taking
But I can't tell if it's real or in my imagination
Spitted so sick that I need a vaccination
But I'm still underrated as fuck
Any occasion that I had to rise to; I did
But they still consider me a gimmick strictly just because of where I live
Dope when I rap I flow; it's my path to blow
This ain't the motherfuckin' white rapper show
Sharpin' skills like katanas in the arms of a ninja
Pure bred with the heart of a winner
Put my all in this shit; if I fall or I trip
I'm just gettin' back up; never callin' it quits
So hard when I spit; you need armor for this
Dusk till dawn till I'm gone I'm a spit
Do it till I die; nothin' less
Word to my very last breath I'm a find my success
Yeah

Are you really here or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth

Reflection from the wet paint got them upset 
Hating me cause I'm moving around town 
But y'all ain't seen nothing; give way my hog 
Get to settle your ass to pound the ground
Fat stack; fat sack; joint is fat
Matter of fact; motherfucker I'm about to clown 
Front back; black Lac; and this black strap 
That have the choir singing to you in the black gown 
And I don't care what they say; I'ma hustle get laid; make money and lounge

아무리 날 설득해도 들리지가 않아
내 귓속에 눈물이 고여 있나 봐
바보 같다 화를 내도 니가 밉질 않아
내 눈 속에 사랑이 맺혀 있나 봐
이렇게 한다고 지금 널 잡는다고
달라질 건 하나도 없고
안 좋게 끝날 뿐이라고
이미 끝났다고 친구들이 말려도
맘이 말을 듣지를 않아
몸이 말을 듣지를 않아
니가 뭐라고 해도 난 못 가
아무리 날 밀쳐도 난 못 놔
여기서 널 놔주면 후회 할 걸 알아
두고 두고 두고 두고
두고 두고 두고 두고 두고
차가운 말 차가운 표정
차가운 행동과
꼭 남에게 하는 듯한 화난 목소리
이 모든 걸 다 보고도
니가 밉질 않아
내 가슴에 사랑이 아직도 남아서
처음 널 만났던 그 때 니 모습들과
나에게 너무 잘해주던
따뜻했던 너의 미소가
아직도 내 눈엔 선한 걸 어떡해
눈이 말을 듣지를 않아
귀가 말을 듣지를 않아
니가 뭐라고 해도 난 못 가
아무리 날 밀쳐도 난 못 놔
여기서 널 놔주면 후회 할 걸 알아
두고 두고 두고 두고
두고 두고 두고 두고 두고

다 헤지고 다 헤져도
아무리 니가 나의 맘을 계속
아프고 아프게 해도

Watsky?

I'm that dork up in the orchestra on oboe; trick 
You're just trying to get some chickens on your pogo stick 
But they'll be hopping off it when you stop the profiting; and then with no dough you'll be like a Dodo when you go extinct 

I'm in San Francisco sipping on a boba drink 
Tapioca in my palm I talk how Yoda thinks 
the voice is so distinct 
I like to write my rhymes with lemon juice 
and so if you don't get it it's in coded ink 

Better believe this 
I'm ready to meet Jesus 
Either him or Willford Brimley when I die from Diabeetus 
I've never been defeated since da fetus days 
lead the way 
Raged out my momma's VJ; crazed and freed the slaves 

Wait I take it back; that's racist and I'd need a time machine 
I'm not pleased to be like T-Pain; a fleeting phase 
But since My pre-Ks in PJs; I pre-date the Bieber craze 
I've been rhyming crispier than Frito-Lays

This is the day for a new beginning
Amazing grace how sweet the sound

The day when life begins

A light shines into the darkness
Bringing hope to the hopeless
It's leading you to life

When all your sins are washed away
In the waves of His unending grace
Forever you're alive

Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost; you’re found; you’re gone

Context clues don’t do much for you
So I’ll leave them buried in the details
If anyone cares; I’m the voice of reason

Because if I bottle up a monster
It only grows; grows; grows
Then why should I expect it gone
Before I’m bones; bones; bones; I’m bones

Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost; you’re found; you’re gone

Context clues don’t do much for you
But I’ll leave them buried in the details
So kids like me can find them
So men like me transcribe them
Save your futures and save yourselves
From industrial; industry hells
Mimicry is flattering
But dangerous and matters to me

Simple steps are all it takes
But steps don’t erase mistakes
Hand it off to me
‘Cause when you’re lost; you’re found; you’re gone
Simple steps are all we need
To dig up these rotten seeds
That are here to sing
That “Today; not tomorrow is ours.”

I won’t let you down
Just promise that you won’t forget about me
I can’t stop the future from settling
But I can change the way it feels
Just promise you won’t forget about me

These shattered pieces form the scars
Tonight we fight; tonight we fall; tonight is when we love again
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Beyond the past; we can make it last; tonight is when we love again
We were made as sons and daughters; by the sins of our fathers
They took fame; we take honor
We were made as sons and daughters; by the sins of our fathers
They took fame; we take honor
Hey...
We were made as sons and daughters; by the sins of our fathers
They took fame; we take honor
Woah...
Tonight we fight; tonight we fall; tonight is when we love
Raise up your glass for broken hearts
These shattered pieces form the scars
Beyond the past; we can make it last; tonight is when we love again

[Intro]
{LISTEN TO THE TRACK; BITCH}
Get out my lane [8X]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm in the yellow thang; on the expressway
That bitch so nasty it might give a bitch road rage
Get out my lane - Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys
I'm ridin in a mansion; but I don't think I'm fancy
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancin
Once upon a time; a little while ago
There was a nigga in a 'rarri with a pretty yellow hoe
Got my head held up; cause I think I'm handsome
As the media portrayin me as Charles Manson
And I coulda bought a Phantom; road here four deeper
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow two-seater
Gucci!

[Chorus 4X: Gucci Mane]
Get out my lane! Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Riding in the 'rarri same color as Bacardi
She don't like me shawty man she like my car
Damn near wanna fuck my chain; damn near wanna fuck my name
Wanna bust every nigga in the clique I claim
Deep-dish rims ain't no offsets mane
That's how me and Gucci Mane came
Iced out poppin shit; drunk switchin lanes
I rock bandanas like Santana; screamin out ""Who want some anna?""
Made a million off my words; they in love with my country grammar
That's the antenna; cause these rap nigga careers got static in it
I'm a walkin meal ticket; just wait a minute
Bank account got commas in it; all black 'rarri know the llamas in it
I hear them talkin gangsta shit but I know they lame as hell
One thing I ain't gon' do; pussy nigga you scared of jail
My name ring bells; my engine loud as hell
Shit; my 'rarri cost about 230 bails

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 4X]
I'm just lane changin; chain swangin [3X]

Jack White,Hypocritical Kiss,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackwhite/hypocriticalkiss.html,"

My temper got the best of me
And when I say that I mean
I know every single thing
That I said was true

And I know that you're mad at me
But if you're thinking like that
I think you'll see that you're
Mad at you too

And I know the feeling's strong
Strong enough to forget about
All that I've been through

And it sounds obscene but
Loud words never bothered
Me like they do to you

You're the boy
That talks but says nothing
A big game to the ones
That you think will believe you

But you don't know how to read
The look on my face when it says
""Yeah; I've read that book too""

And who the hell's impressed by you?
I want names of the people
That we know that are falling for this

You would sell your own mother out
And then betray your dead brother with another
Hypocritical kiss

What up
Dizzy Wright nigga
I had to turn my mothafuckin swag on

[Verse 1:]
East side Vegas where I'm at ho;
Took a long time but we comin' through the back door.
21 young doing anything I want; turned a rap concert to a tat show.
That cold better believe that we gas flows; likable assholes
Man I'm wilin' in this bitch; I'm stylin' need a couple 100 thousand
I don't see no haters smiling when I bring funk volume in this bitch
(Hold up)
Vegas on the map; made it on the map; when you think of west coast think of Dizzy wright nigga
Put my whole life in this rap shit; here 'em talk shit that's the reason I don't like niggas
I was putting in my ground work; down to earth; sound surfaced to the sound work
Found the sound now I'm traveling around earth;
Smoked a whole pound just to show 'em what the town worth
(Like)

[Chorus: x2]
Climbed up in the game; you a lame; I can tell you signed up for the fame (for the fame)
Now you might have a name; it's a shame cause we can see through everything that you ain't (who you ain't)
I think it's time for a change so they left it to a nigga like me
So it's only wright that I give it to 'em real shit I'm tryna make you think so it's easier to live (so I tell em like)

[Verse 2:]
If it's hot then it's probably this; marijuana where the party is
I'm so out of the loop; I talk shit when I walk in the booth; and hit a hater with a hockey stick
I got a problem with the hoes; low key hoes proud of being hoes;
Hide behind your Prada that's what bothers me the most.
Say she ain't easy; money make her come so she try to see me and I don't be acknowledging the hoes
Poppin' up for shows; gettin' dough; signed a couple autographs and hit the door nigga what (nigga what)
You be on that sucka shit; hit the club; hump a bitch; take a bitch home and you can't get it up (get it up)
Young nigga; I'm one nigga; I don't like thirsty ass bitches that want niggas
Me I'm on some shit as hot as the sun nigga; dumb figures is gettin me through to the dumb niggas (like)

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]
Tatted; they don't really wanna hear my voice;
No choice I'm the hottest nigga doing it
Only being confident cause I ain't politic my progress
Do it big I don't give a fuck who it is. 1990 hooligan; finna shoot again
I'm a get it in till they do me in
I told my niggas that I want the whole bank; put the gas in the tank
And tell all the homies scoot it in
Bitch we headed to the top ho; top floor we could lock doors; lowkey cause the cops close
We down; we got smoke; never with the drama; do a show then we outro (letem know)
Told Vegas I was down for it; constant sessions didn't lounge on it;
Heard em hating but I'm too busy to be around for it
Now I'm certain that these niggas certain; cause me I am perfectly perfect with all of my verses
I tell em like

This is a love song for myself
I'm not gonna talk about you in it
Except to say
I burned the teddy bear you gave me
Well; not really
But I thought about it real hard
This is take two of getting over you
Why do they call it that?
I feel so low; low to the ground
I could be your weevil
Did you know that they are herbivores?
They don't eat meat
I wonder if they break hearts

I will remember what it's like to feel entire
I will remember what it's like to feel entire
I will remember what it's like to feel entire

I think that me
Could really use some spoiling
I'm gonna paint my toenails green
Walk around like my feet are the front lawn
And I am and I am and I am a castle
You; can call me Alcazar

It's motherfuckin' gang land my nigga
It's Taylor Gang or die nigga
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's Chevy; you know what I'm sayin'?
I do this shit for real my nigga
You know? A lot of motherfuckers got a lot of shit to say but um
I think that this tape is gonna set a few niggas straight
You know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna ruler you niggas out; one time
And that's Gang Land; shout out to the Cap; shout out to my block
4400; you know what it is
We do it for the hood my nigga
Gang Land

It's one thing to act cool; it's another thing just to be it
I guess you niggas blind to the fact
So that explains why you don't see it
Let's work; uh

And that's TGOD
1 double O 8; that's the square root of white
Money comin' so fast I was countin' all night
And mom's gonna do it cause I have my own cash
And I don't need hers cause I have my own bed
I was thievin' like Scarface; table full of white
When I spin on that shit I make it back by the night
Yea; that's one wrong move; chopper boy's on call
I remember nights lookin' to the sky; oh Lord
That's quality over quantity any day
In that California Kobe cush firin' up them J's
Had a plug for my niggas; I felt like they was me
With a plan to get money that you'll probly never see
I'm talkin' 50 of them things; every three days
Poppin' champagne; lookin' at my niggas; weed pay
All we know is hustle; you should understand that
What you know about road trips and it ain't comin' back
When you hear it it's a numb feeling runnin' through your veins
But what you gonna do? You'll probly go insane
Couple homies in the grave; I wish I could call
Few niggas turned on me; thought them niggas was my dogs
When a nigga tryin' to eat it ain't never too much
Burnin' weed down the interstate I'm fuckin' with the clutch
I'm livin' life fast; nigga Taylor Gang that
Bitch; we've been head straight; it's run until you Gang that
Throwin' money overseas; yea nigga; did that

And loyalty is some shit you ain't gotta give back
Yea; that's family; our get together and that's just rap
Don't even know each other's last names and that's fact

Loyalty is some shit you ain't gotta give back
Only get together's family; our niggas just rap
Don't even know each other's last names and that's fact

So I got one question for y'all
What's rap to you?
Yea; TGOD

Smoke a lot of weed; do a lot of drinkin'
Got my mind on this money; 'bout this money I've been thinkin'

Okay; walk with me a moment through this beat we make it go
Follow me up into the clouds; I'm a break it down below
I'm a get 'em up get 'em up get it poppin' now
Boomboxes knock the ground; better get this fuckin' loud
Enemies tuck ya cock in now
Wild buffalo; bill me for shuckin' flows
Claim you get Hulk but all I see is Mark Ruffalo
Went on the road; smashin' records like a day trip
Came back home and all my friends have gone apeshit
Breaking codes; as far as cowards go they should take the gold
Calling out the Gods? You the one that's out there fakin' so
Dirty hippie creepin' leakin' out the mouth
Pull your shit together; crashin' cribs and sleepin' on the couch
Plexo told me kill the diplomatic shit so
I'm a slay the sick and give your trickin' acrobatic lift [?]
Lift with dick why you liftin' shit with Olympus kid?
I'm Olympic prick and an instant fit [?] shit; you an infant bitch!
Made man is runnin' muck around the planet
God damn it my language makin' mamas wet they pajamas
Rockin' Thrift Store; Halos
My spit's more; Kano
Got heart; but I bet it ain't a smart
But I'm bringin' out a dart in the dark better lay low
Got Bane on the brain; propane inside my bravado
And the stadium seated executions in Colorado
Goddamn [?] ya Lord got really fuckin' odd plans
If he returns; tell him bring lots of ammo and stop playin'; amen
This is ground zero for the skeptics
My vocal cords septic; my family tree metric
She seen I had British roots upon my arrival
'Til I swang my rafiki at a bitch half of me is tribal
Rivals beware! Claim that I could be the best yet
No way to be the next Tech so I just be the best Wrek
Expect records to wreck your neck up like Death - Leps
Send 'em in quick and pretend you'll neck I'm so deaf to death; yes
This is a warning; I told you I'm 'Good Good Night' to get mourning
For the beats under my cleats all of these wack rap performers!
And now I'm feelin' Damien; still I got my halo on
Next week we'll be gathering which liquor mixed with Fago; huh!?
This is one of four; so run for the fuckin' door
I've come for the fuckin' floor; and once I own it what's in store?
Porch flows; chaos in the scorched shows
Séance and of course though; Snake and Bat Morse Codes

They say we got five months left 'til the end of the world
So you better cash in on your souls
I got a birds-eye view; subterranean flow
All the majors said; ""Thanks; but no""
Now I got a doped up deal with the Snake and the Bat
Don't try to act like you didn't know
I put a decade in the game; now I'm here for my change
Let's spin this motherfucka into gold [?]

She had enough of the hometown boys
There's a lot of talk and a lot of noise
She said; ""They just don't dream big enough for me""

Came through with the rodeo
When she saw how fast his horse could go
He won more than a race that day
Her heart; her hand
And when he held her; she said

'Round here the grass is always green
So this can't be the up side of anything
Maybe I can't see the forest for the trees
Or maybe there ain't nothing here for me
But more lonely

Her cowboy ain't ever home
She sleeps in a big ol' bed alone
Drives the Cadillac but no babies in the back

He promised her with a shiny ring
She'd never want for anything
But money just ain't good company I guess
The night she left he read the note; and it said

'Round here the grass is always green
So this can't be the up side of anything
Maybe I can't see the forest for the trees
Or maybe there ain't nothing here for me
But more lonely; oh

I'd give the world up just to hold you
When the stars fill up the sky
They got nothing on your eyes
What's it gonna take to show you

When it all becomes too much
I hope this song will be enough

Aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; aye. Aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; oh
When the stars fill up the sky
Aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; aye. Aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; aye; oh

I can't get a drink in Harlan County
I can't get a drink and I don't know why
Why I every came to Harlan County
Harlan County's damn near dry

Well; you can get a drink in Harlan County
Go to the city of Cumberland
Go to the package store on main street
A twenty dollar bill in your right hand

I can't get a drink in Harlan County
I can't get a drink and I don't know why
Why I every came to Harlan County
Harlan County's damn near dry

Climbed to the top of Old Black Mountain
That's the highest peak in Kentucky
And if you're tired; drunk; or crazy
Drive on up in an ATV

I saw a bear up on black mountain
Carrying a six pack in his claw
I shot that bear; and I took his six pack
Yes; I guess I broke the law

I can't get a drink in Harlan County
I can't get a drink and I don't know why
Why I every came to Harlan County
Harlan County's damn near dry

Yeah; they play a little golf in Harlan County
Huntin'; fishin'; campin' too
Still got coal mines down in Harlan
I'd stay outta them if I was you

They cook a little meth in Harlan County
Chemistry in the kitchen sink
Less you're over in Cumberland City
A thirsty man can't get a drink

I can't get a drink in Harlan County
I can't get a drink and I don't know why
Why I every came to Harlan County
Harlan County's damn near dry

If that's true; If you don't know who I am; then maybe the best course would be to tread lightly

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Listen bitch
Better tread lightly; I put 'em to bed nightly
You'll never see me tired; and losing is less likely
I got the haters mad because their chick is my next wifey
(Keep talking) I don't care if i got your respect; bite me
Y'all think that people up and Connecticut can't rap
Well watch as me and Ap' go and put an end to that
While these other rappers counting their chickens before they hatch
I said fuck it; and made them over easy with some hash
(Oh My God he's on the drugs again) Urine so dirty
Only at my local deli am I going cold turkey
So much musical knowledge they're asking if I went to Berklee
Leaving third degree burns on the microphone until they heard me
I roll around with eighteen birdies; and I ain't playing golf
Just them Kit-Kat bitches; I got to break them off
Got them breathing heavy as Vader giving a monologue
Mazel-tov; Wolf in the game; you just a common dog
I don't even care
My name be ringing bells like Hector Salamanca with dynamite in his wheelchair
So get right; C. Webby is dead nice
You don't know me so trust me bitch; just tread light

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me; you better tred light
Oh you people got a lot to say; well okay step up to the mic
(Step; Step up; Step up)
But you ain't my homie; so i'm not gonna play nice
All I need is sixteen bars; swear to God I could end your life
(Take that motherfuckers)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Shatter matter; at a rate the fake evaporate
Evacuate the wake; then lay the body; I decapitate
I take the head; take you to the hood of my whip
Foot on the metal wood and grip; floating like a wooden ship
Shouldn't shitty rappers ask us permission to rhyme?
Permission declined; the mics booby trapped with fishing line
Finna' shine since a fetus; I can see the finish line
Vicious mind; victims lying in blood when I split your spine
Now I'm spying on these bitches showing tithes on vine
Looking pretty; hoes pose in front of Hollywood signs
If it comes to Me and You; you lose every time
I been deadly with the rhymes since Nirvana Nevermind
Never whine; never crying; never dying; I'm designed
Out of iron; I'm a lion; I'm defined as divine
I'm Allah; I'm Jehovah; Amen-rah; I'm a soldier
I'm a boulder-moving mutant; super human; shit its over
Supernova; super soaker full of acid; I'm blasting
I'm blacking out; passing out laughing at the fact that you rapping
I'm rapidly cracking you crackers into cabbages for bragging
I'm body bagging hoes; y'all shorter then Bilbo Baggins

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me; you better tred light
Oh you people got a lot to say; well okay step up to the mic
(Step; Step up; Step up)
But you ain't my homie; so i'm not gonna play nice

Wild Cub,Jonti,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildcub/jonti.html,"

In the crisp seclusion
Timid impulses hidden and turned
Dormant possibilities
Compromised and shadowed and turned away

In this suspension
This pre-pubescent age
The very real question of what will remain at the thaw
I don’t know

Somewhere in the middle
I stood standing
I didn’t know it but I’d never understand it; no
There’s no explanation
There’s no answer
Lines crooked like the center of your hands and oh

I see it now
It’s brighter when the lights are out

Behind the closed door
It’s turning off and on
The light from below blinks true
It blinks true
And what does it say to you?

I see that raw spark sinking
The faded blinking and the big man winking at you

Everything the sun touch; belongs to me
And everywhere the moon creeps; is where I be
It's simply no defeating us
We can't be beat
You see HollowSquad the regimen; pull the strings
I stomp you boys from underneath; stay away from me
We pull up to your venue; and crush the whole thing
I might let her smoke the blunt but not the whole thing
I'm higher than the Gundam wing; eating chicken wings
I know this girl from Asia; all I say is dong ding
She flipped them words around then she descend to her knees
Bitch I don't say please I'm just taking what I please
Boy; stay the fuck up out my way before I swing on ye
He thought that I was playin' till he saw me on his street
All these rap niggas need help; so they listenin' to me
I got ears in the streets; I got eyes in the streets
Bitch talkin' shit 'bout me can get you mangled in your sleep
I ain't ever been a bitch; boy ask anyone with me
You can copy all my style but you can't copy my unique
All I do is roll a blunt and keep watch on the sea
I'm a Bloodshore lord; can't no human tangle me
Put my blade in his mouth; now let this pussy boy speak
I will cut his teeth up out his gums if he lie on me
I won't ever become weak. I can't ever become weak
Cause the truth is in my strength that let's me swing so freely
All I want to do is smoke my weed; and live in peace
But these idiots in the world; make it hard to keep it clean
Tell the children wait inside while I'm on the killing spree
Tell the children close their eyes while the blood cover me
We don't need no damn help; all you labels lookin' silly
Why the fuck would we sell music; when we sellin' out the building
We don't need no gas; we on E; driving fast; smokin' on a new zip
I ain't even finished with my last; bitch

Ho il tocco french delle banlieue
Voglio cash e cagne come Kanye
Non voglio fan mie coetanee; voglio gagne
Fresh come tua sorella e le compagne
I giovani sono il fottuto futuro
La metà di questa gente c'ha la testa infilata nel culo
Figli del caos; figli del mouse
Ho visto cessi pubblici e ci ho scritto ""CasaPound""
Ho visto la Madonna; ho scritto ""t'amo"" con la bamba
Sul cd di Rihanna che ho rubato all'Autogrill
Ho scritto un'altra bomba; carta canta; crolla un'altra banca
""Ho visto come sopravvivere grazie a Bear Grylls""
Dalla commedia all'italiana alle tragedie greche il passo è breve
Croci al contrario sulle vostre schede
Rompo la quiete che preannuncia la tempesta
Arrivo con un Entact alla fiesta

Non incazzarti
Siamo partiti col piede sbagliato come Zanardi
Ma tu ti esalti tanto; saltimbanco
Rimo talebano; sono il Talib bianco
Siamo capi di branco; mi illumino di Manson
Nel pubblico ai tuoi live; Richard Benson
Spacchi? Non penso
Mi posti il video; ma non commento
Mantengo un briciolo di buon senso
Scrivo il futuro come Asimov; spezzo pane azzimo
Ammazzo con la penna come in Casinò
Beat di grosso calibro; socio; paura e panico
Voi manigoldi senza manico
Da lucido ho troppo cervello
Io mi drogo per riuscire a rapportarmi a voi
Io non rimo; ti leggo dentro il cervello
E no; non sono tuo fratello

She'd hang on every word
If you listen more for her
I'm everything you say
Should keep them all inside
But the vowel she never heard

That day never came
But she wants you all the same
Though she never heard you say
I am here to stay

Just a little love; it goes a long long way
So why not start today
It's all on you
I'm not gonna pick
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do
It's all on you
So tell me what you want
Need to find the words; baby
Before the nights over

If the sun is almost up
Why are stars still in my eyes (still in my eyes)
They never go away
And wishing you could find a place under my sky

That day never came
But I want you all the same
Though I never heard you say
I am here to stay

Just a little love; it goes a long long way
So why not start today
It's all on you
I'm not gonna pick
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do

So tell me what you want
Need to find the words; baby

Won't you tell me; baby
Won't you tell me; before the nights over
Won't you tell me
Won't you say it; baby
Won't you tell me; before the nights over

Before the nights over
Don't you love me too

Am I wasting my time here waiting for you
It's almost daylight
Don't know what to do
I see in you eyes
But I still need more proof
It won't come from my mouth
Now it's all on you

All on you
I'm not gonna pick
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do
It's all on you
So tell me what you want
Need to find the words; baby
Before the nights over

Won't you tell me
Won't you tell me; baby
Won't you tell me; before the nights over

Won't you say it; baby

She's hidden her babies away

Their soft; gummy smiles
won't be gilding the menu.

The deer fly; the sand fly;
the tsetse can't find them.

The goon from the Stasi
is left far behind them.

Their delicate derma
won't witness a ray.

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

No 'Raindrops on roses'.
'Whiskers on kittens'.

They refuse to be blinded
by Rubens or Poussin.

They'll hardly be boarding
the 12:10 to Tucson.

Is she shaking them hard
in dry run cabaret?

She's hidden her babies away

Ho; Ho; watenay
Ho; Ho; watenay
Ho; Ho; watenay
I'm closing in.
I'm closing in.

She's hidden her babies away

And why bring them out
with no shelter to offer.

The nurseries and creches
are heavily with lush lice.

Bubonic; blue blankets;
run ragged with church mice.

The Havana has died
in the clam-shell ashtray.

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

From posed; high;
pelvic bridges.

Pearly bone
mountain ridges.

No hiccupy silence
to finger their traces.

No colicky moon
shines bright pain
on their faces.

She has slipped
through the dark
like a mother moray.

She's hidden her babies away

Ho; Ho; watenay
Ho; Ho; watenay
Ho; Ho; watenay
I'm closing in.
I'm closing in.

I've come searching;
from far and away.

A r-e-a-c-h-i-n-g;L-o-n-g-A-r-m-e-d
vet ape
feeling hard
for a breech birth.

I gaze up at the night
at the asterisk's blazing.

Til they straighten;
and like tiny spines;
fall to earth.

I bite down on this
as I dance
and I pray.

She's hidden her babies away

I was wearing white shoes.

Take this good advice
If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white
You'll be alright
Said you'll be alright
Said you'll be alright

Gucci iced out; whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion
Being forreal; yo try being Pharrell
When your black ass in a back class; the fronting was real
No Lauren London; we was on a budget
You know; sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin'; 'bout how you're lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams

Biotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager; managin' us
Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them Js for the low; low; and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience; I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift; then again I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar
Cause out come them niggas with pistols; tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone; income was very uh
On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1
And Reebok would carry pump; and that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them

Another lost cause
She's messing with a lot of things
She wants the applause
She's gonna give up everything... off we go
Into the wild and dangerous side
Been through a lot of pain... help
Another lost cause
She's messing with a lot of things; a lot of things and now she turns it up!

All night; we breakin' off
That's why; she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm 18 in the clutch
Woman; who you callin'? Captain love

Yea; I'll be your captain; we can't slow this thing down
She'll make your jaw drop
Despise the fashion but you wear the shoes
Don't let your heart stop
You'll be ready once you pay your dues
Into the wild and dangerous side
Where there's no one to blame
Another lost cause
We're messing with a lot of things; a lot of things and now we turning up!

All night; we breakin' off
That's why; she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm 18 in the clutch
Woman; she's calling captain love

It's not a lost cause
You know we all want everything
It's just some old laws
That keep us judging; breaking wings; but so what?
It's time to turn it up!

All night; we breakin' off
That's why; she calling captain love
I'm forty five but I'm18 in the clutch
Woman; aren't you? Captain love
Calling captain love; o? calling my number baby
Yea yea yea... they call me the captain
Woah woman; I'll be your captain on this ride

My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

No one else will do...

Your eyes; your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes; you will always be

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever

I can't resist your charms

I drown in the oceans
That keep us apart
Mapping distant stars
Oh their voices call me
To the shelter of your skin
Where the end begins

Oh I'm fading through
Oh I'm fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

I'd climb on rooftops
To catch a glimpse of the moon
A fading trail of you
A mountain of effort
And a wall of prayer
But this war is to the death

Oh we're fading through
Oh we're fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

Oh we're fading through
Oh we're fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

Can you make this new?
Can you make this new?
Body crumbles to dust
But I can't lose you

Yo; turned Judas for the Yeezy 2's
Balmain biker suit with no bike
The Royce got no roof
Feel like I've been sellin' dope my whole life
Céline on my team
A.P.C Kanye saggin' in my dreams
Ran trains on Vera Wang; pray for Paris then you pray for me
Madonnas on the mock necks
Wave the MACs out the drop head
Sportin' DM in the BMs
Even the blind man he tryin' to see the Feds
So now these all have zip
Sharks on the Givenchys; who wanna swim?
Gargle with Belaire; beware
Style so dope; Versace brains on the stairs
Elegance; Pyrex for measurements
Iceberg history; your misery; your missin' the concepts
Android homie; your home; where the work?
Just Don; Dobermans on the shirt
Before I starve; hit up Chow's with the mob
Breakin' bricks at Joyrich; we rich
Shootouts at Bally's; left his brains on the suede joints
Yo Lord; I think I'm motherfuckin' hit
Throwin' testers out the window
Fiends scramblin'; I'm just dancin' in my Kenzo
Pump the Enzo; wack crack spot mascots
For Mulberry drug dealer dreams came true
Don't get your moms buried; stylin'
Margiela Gats and the most sane
Pissin' D'Ussé for a week straight
Saint Laurent over the Glock; kick in your door
All you seen was red bottom on the moccasins

Thank God he gave us drug dealin'
Thank God he gave us drug dealin'
Thank God he gave us drug dealin'

Yo; got the Rav joint watermelon
You saw the real in my eyes to where your powder swimmin'
Will fly fry God blessin' America
Pardon my back; Pyrex; two-three cover the MAC
Immaculate with a half a brick
Bag the fish; then I scramble like Kaepernick
Niggas know my repertoire
I dropped real tears when kid shot Escobar
Best of all time when it come down to this fly shit
All star; my rhyme; crime; drive-bys; line for line sick
Sportin' Junn.J in Doomsday; compare me to you day; room spray
Got the beam on the Glock tip
Popped up in the drop six and shot fifths
Caused the riot up at Neiman Mar
Gas stoves; use the hammer or the fork

Thank God he gave us drug dealin'
Thank God he gave us drug dealin'
Thank God he gave us drug dealin'

I was only asking for a moment of the truth
I can't fight the feeling when I'm hanging out with you
Why do I forgive you
Because I get confused
I could never leave behind the part of me that you refuse

Ooh

I was on the ceiling I could almost feel the sun
Try the words in sequence but that's never how it's done
Why do our disasters creep so slowly into view
I was only after a friend to follow through
I couldn't lose

I know why you don't really know me
I don't think you can call it home
All alone I couldn't taste another thing

I was on the ceiling and I swore it might be true
I could fight the feeling but not quite as well as you

I don't know; won't you come and show me
I don't think it's what you did before
All alone I couldn't take a case like you

Money first then my eyes close
From a good yute to a psycho
I'm that nigga that they rate on the mic tho
But they hate on the roads nigga try know
This my letter to the roads
Been a mad time but soon I got to go
Started off hood rapping with the bros
So I'm still baffed when I'm getting money for a show
Banged a lot of niggas in their face
I did 2 bill moves then put Gucci on my waist
Now I got P's for a crib and a Range
So I'm thinking in my head ""Whens a nigga gonna change?""
It cool tho; take it in my [?]
If I don't blow then Terry from the 9 will
Even when I finish with this road ting
Violate me and you still will get a poking
'Cause I can't help the way my mind changes
One day you goin' see me in the front pages
Hope you don't see me for the wrong reasons
Tryin' to have a 100 mill when I'm not dreaming
A lot of niggas want to take my life
Need to make a choice either fight or flight
You already know nigga; I'ma ride
People goin' still say my name if I'm not alive

If I love you then trust me I'm the nicest
If I know you got the belly then your boys Peaking
Then I watch crime watch with my heart beating
Live a bad life but I polish it
Still got my Cartier through the politics
Big shanks; big [?]

Let love make a fool out of me
This one time - please; just let me be
I've never known how to get both feet off the ground
Let love make a fool out of me

Let's say; love can set you free
I'm a believer; until I get cold feet
I just want someone to hold me
Without looking over my shoulder
Let love make a fool out of me

I just sit by the phone and pretend I'm not home
Pace the floor 'til you knock on my door
If I could know what it's like to just lose my mind
Maybe; my heart could win this time

Once I got it; don't take it from me
I've found a good one - please; just let me be
He's got eyes like the night and hair like the sea
Let love make a fool out of me

My lips grow cold; and my eyes tend to wander
I choke on my words; and my hands start to falter
I've never known how to get both feet off the ground
But if I could; I'd love you like I should

I just sit by the phone and pretend I'm not home
Pace the floor 'til you knock on my door
If I could know what it's like to just lose my mind
Maybe; my heart could win this time

Found a good one - please; let me believe
That it could save me this time
Salvation would be mine

Each without a saddle; still ridin' for a will
They don't eat or drink; hell they're barely standin' still
Nine black horses day to day and nine black horses still

Nine white horses standin' on a hill
Each with empty saddles; their reins pulled tight by a will
They don't shake or stir; no they stand strong and still
Nine white horse day to day; nine white horses still

The angels will pick you up and claim you if you are saved
One thing you have to do is pick your side
Saddle up and ride

Temptation is the breaker of a man
It'll haunt you faster than night falls across this land
You don't want your sins scarred upon your hands
Nine black horses day to day and nine black horses still

Salvation is a winding narrow road
The ground will start to break the faster that you go
You best watch your speed boy; sit back and take it slow

Taken for a fool 
As they sharpen their knives 
Stab me with my trust once again

I shall not mourn 
Yesterday's tears 
All that is gone 
And all that once was here 
I shall not mourn the past 
The days; the months or the years 
Yesterday's tears 

Saddened and betrayed 
Yet unbroken; I walk amongst the liars and the thieves 
Nothing ever lasts 
It's been spoken 
Compassion died; yet no one ever grieved

Well it's hard when I lack the composure and no sort of vanity
Barely managing
Cause' the weight on my shoulder's a boulder that's crumbling down on me
I'm not down never out for the count and I
Find death always creeping around
So what am I supposed to say that I'm better of this way
(Cause' I'm in for the long run)

I want to feel fire in my lungs
I want to taste pride beneath my tongue
I want to be someone that I'm not

And maybe I'd be better off
Taking what I've got
And leaving behind the things I've lost
I want to feel what it's like to be the good enough
To be the good enough

It's scary taking on a life like mine
Well I'm far from your best bet
I try to stray from in between the lines
Cause' it's hard when I fake this
Call me a scumbag can I get my luck back

Alive in disguise
Just a hot mess in progress
If it's a fucking contest give me a sign

Are you still on the cover or

Calling all the angels; we must have an intervention
The land and the air and Marianne are in contention
The land wants the tongue and the air wants the spirit
But it's all inside the heart and Marianne won't let them near it

Said; are you still a lover boy?

Are you still a lover boy?
Still laughing on the cover or
Did you become a valley boy out there?

Summer; water; fall and fire
All has fallen out of order

La da da da da

And you say
""This would've never happened if you coulda changed"" (I swear)
I'll call you on your shit
A long time ago I would've fell for it
But I'm passed that
I'm taking my whole life back
'Cause I've found
This love was a lie

It's like a game
You break my heart and tell me I'm to blame
But I fell for it like I fell for you
To many times and nothing seems to
Change
You break my heart and tell me I'm insane
But I'm over it like I'm over you
And I'm moving on I'm telling you

La da da da da
La da da da

And I know
You're not who you say you are
(Say you are)
Yes I know
You've taken this too far
(Taken this too far)

It's like a game
You break my heart and tell me I'm to blame
But I fell for it like I fell for you
To many times and nothing seems to
Change
You break my heart and tell me I'm insane
But I'm over it like I'm over you
And I'm moving on I'm telling you

It's like a game
(La da da da da)
You break my heart and tell me I'm to blame
(La da da da)
But I fell for it; like I fell for you
(La da da da da da)
To many times and nothing seems to
Change

You break my heart and tell me I'm insane
(La da da da)
But I'm over it like I'm over you

He gotta be kidding me; Chesney
Every time I turn the ignition; you're on the radio again
And in the shotgun of my vision
There she is where she was but she's not
Thanks a lot man
Hey like my heart needs your help in the breaking department
Yeah she's already got that taken care of
No offense but

Shut up Kenny
Leave me alone; keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt?
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
Come on Kenny
Man you know I like your music
But I hate the way I loved the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up Kenny

Kenny please
Hell even your new tracks hurt
Your voice is like a mean time machine
It only goes backwards
Ain't a station you ain't on
Need to change it but I don't really want to
I just keep loving her
And hating you

Shut up Kenny
Leave me alone; keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt?
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
Come on Kenny
Man you know I like your music
But I hate the way I loved the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up Kenny
Shut up Kenny

Shut up Kenny
Leave me alone; keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt?
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
Come on Kenny
Man you know I like your music
But I hate the way I loved the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't

Shut up Kenny (Every time I turn the ignition)

Come on Kenny (Every time I turn the ignition)
Every time I turn the ignition; you're on the radio again

Well; why don't you love me like you used to do
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long; long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So; why don't you love me like you used to do

Well; why don't you be just like you used to be
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long; long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile

Why don't you say the things you used to say
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do

I want you badly; you know you have me
Girl; I wanna get to know ya'
And you so sassy; the way you grab me
Got your hand around my shoulder

She said; ""Just keep dancing; boy
You know you handsome; boy
I love your voice and when you talk; I'm crying tears of joy
These boys don't treat you right
My love will give you life
Just let me take the wheel and I could take you for a ride""

Girl; you need somebody; not the average guy
Someone who makes you naughty and keeps you satisfied
He can please your body about half the time
You should leave him sorry; I'll keep you satisfied
Wooh; I'll keep you satisfied
Wooh; I'll keep you satisfied
Wooh; I'll keep you satisfied
I'll keep; I'll keep you

I'll make you happy; I'll make you laugh; b
I'll make you melt when I hold ya'
Take you to London; take you to Paris
Girl; I might just have to show ya'

I said; ""Just keep dancing; girl
Let's make this fancy; girl
I'll kiss your neck; and kiss your lips and then I'll make you twirl""

Hopped in the Tesla; late for my session
Damn; forgot it was electric
Mind-blown 'cause you got my attention
Ass like that; I ain't looking at the next chick
Woke up; got some head instead of breakfast
'Cause you gotta earn your spot on the guestlist
19 and she looking so reckless
Tryna cross everything off a checklist
Vans scuffed up from the blacktop
Got a sex tape on my laptop
Got a hard drive full of back shots
Ooh; my iCloud 'bout to pop off
Girl; we should probably get a move on
Swear this won't take too long
I'ma change up your whole world
Go and tell me what you want; yeah

Se fossi in me saremmo in troppi
E già qui dentro c'è una gran confusione
Serve l'immagine; la comunicazione
Devo cambiare connessione
Se fossi in me saremmo in troppi
E già qui dentro c'è una gran confusione
Mi serve un leader d'opinione che mi dia un'indicazione:
Sono più Rap o più Indie; cazzone?

Non ricordo dove ho letto
Che forse ai vostri cani non piace la techno
Spariti i sogni dal cassetto?
Beh; qui la vita è ingiusta
E i vostri sogni in un sacchetto
Forse è più corretto busta
Quindi butta male
Voce del verbo sputtanare
Per dedurre che si può ballare pure senza assumere
O lavorare senza essere assunti
Io non giudico nessuno
Mi faccio un'idea
Se vuoi ti do gli appunti
Ma mi spiegate perché ogni cosa che fate
Quando vi schierate si trasforma in una gara a squadre
Basta un attimo; fine del dibattito fra due tifoserie
Che tanto le idee giuste son le mie
Tanti argomenti senza un'argomentazione
Amore senza precauzione
Fede senza imprecazione
Ma i cani son meglio delle persone che dicono che i cani son meglio delle persone

Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)

Lei mi dice che deve lasciarlo come fosse un altro impegno in agenda:
""Eh il martedì ho pole dance e c'ho un esame a fine mese quindi Marco; boh; lo lascio intorno al 30""
Sai che cosa mi spaventa?
Che la gente si accontenta
La gente si addormenta
E 'sti stronzi qua qualcuno li stipendia
Quindi pungi come un tossico
Vola come una bestemmia
E lascia che si insultino a vicenda
Nella vostra trasgressione c'è un sacco di conformismo
In tutto quel disagio c'è un sacco di narcisismo
E senza offesa; ma vestirsi male e avere un pessimo rapporto col cazzo; mia cara; non c'entra niente col femminismo
Che fine ha fatto l'umorismo
Togliti il palo dal culo
E lascia stare il catechismo
Che tanto non fa effetto; no
Non sono neanche battezzato
E se Dio esiste è pure peggio
Perché è evidente; ha cazzeggiato

Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì
Dite Amen — (Amen)
Le preghiere non funzionano ma le bestemmie sì

E i cani son meglio delle persone che dicono che i cani son meglio delle persone
E i cani son meglio delle persone che dicono che i cani son meglio delle persone
Se fossi in me saremmo in troppi
Che già qui dentro c'è una gran confusione
Ma i cani son meglio delle persone che dicono che i cani son meglio delle persone

So said the spider to the fly
Welcome to my web
I'll slowly watch you die

Now you're hoping and praying
Everything will be okay
Don't hold your breath my love
No not today

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight

It's just so sad that you're so dumb
Now I devour you in this nightmare that I've spun

Now you're begging
And you're screaming for me to end the pain
Don't hold your breath my love
No not today

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight
And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight

It's too bad; things had to end this way
But I promise; to end it oh so violently
Now I; sink my fangs so deep down inside you
Your blood; I need; now won't you give it all to me

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight
And there's no way you're getting out alive

I drive deep in the valley so the stars can shine
I was hoping to trip with a friend of mine
But my friend's in trouble with the boys in blue
A mercurial tribe who decide what's true

I'm gonna let go of feeling low
I'm gonna let go of feeling low
I'm gonna lose my cool looking in the rearview
I'm gonna let go of feeling low

I came back to the city with an open heart
It swallowed me up with all its boyish charm
But the charm won't last past the strike of the night
I have to let it all out before I lose this fight

I'm gonna let go of feeling low
I'm gonna let go of feeling low
I'm gonna lose my cool looking in the rearview
I'm gonna let go of feeling low

(Oh; you are so special)

We make it something
Tonight; us two; we can embroider the space between the brilliant stars
If you want to; tell me
Your breath; the closer it gets; it thrills me; yeah

I go especially overboard today; mousse in my hair; no no
It looks outdated so I use wax to make it look natural
The expensive clothes I hid well look good on me
There’s word that the atmosphere is great
My wallet is fat; cash; check; to see you; leggo!

Actually; I want you
It’s you (you) It’s you (you)

You’re probably unfamiliar with everything about me
I naturally dive into your embrace in a second
Harmoniously; we bloom

As the night deepens
We become skin scuba divers that swim into a darker place
Like the surface of the ocean in the middle of summer
Sparks are flying; anybody don’t touch me

My heart is tingling; tingling
Red lipstick; I want it; baby
Your anxious eyes are dancing

I want to set fire to your heart
I’m curious about what you look like
When you can’t take it and scream; yeah

You make me feel so special tonight
Tonight; tonight; with you
JINU I might burn out in a few moments but
I like it; alright

Instead of sleep; I’ve fallen into you
Instead of a blanket; I want to pull you close
Tell me your honest feelings; show me your heart

That you only waited for this moment too
Same days; days; days; I can make it
Feel the special night; let go of yourself today
Same days; days; days; I can make it
Feel the special night; grab unto my waist

The Wild Feathers,Every Morning I Quit Drinkin',2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wildfeathers/everymorningiquitdrinkin.html,"

In these monumental mornings
You stole everything I saw
But not before I gave a warning
Hit the road before you fall

Every morning I quit drinkin'
Every morning; quit the smoke
But every evening; there's a sadness
Reminding me my heart's still broke

By the middle of the night; I'm rolling in sin
This old highway knows I still love her
This old highway is a friend

I tried walking on the water
My failure watches from the shore
To be honest; it was harder
Than it seemed the night before

'Cause in the middle of the night; I'm rolling in sin
This old highway knows I still love her
This old highway is my friend

Every morning I quit drinkin'
But; every morning; hear the sound
My broken heart's still breaking
Waiting on yours to come around

Beyond the pines are the breeze I shoot
There's a place where I undo
And it happens all the time
I'm immune to goodbyes; oh
Swiss watch and a baseball cap
Won't go far with a face like that
Still they keep me wanting more
A church with a locked door

You keep me wanting more

Everything gets blurry; am I right where you want me?
Melting like an ice cream in the sun
He's low and she's high; but I take it offline
Is there really such a thing as too much fun?
An ice cream in the sun

Art imitates life again
Rose and I used to be friends
We'd hang out from time to time
When we could toe the line; oh
What I like in humility
My ego pays back to me
And it keeps me wanting more
A church with a locked door

You keep me wanting more

Everything gets blurry; am I right where you want me?
Melting like an ice cream in the sun
He's low and she's high; but I take it offline
Is there really such a thing as too much fun?

Hating my life; oh; I can paint you a picture

Drown in my sorrow cause I don't know if I could getcha
See my mind been feeling gone like I don't know
I been poppin' on Percs like they Tylenols

When I'm withdrawing; bawling; can't fight 'em all
Better yet; yo; my soul done dropped; my holster popped
Killed who dealt; they know to not
Now look; nigga; listen; I was lost a lot
Trapped in Hell with no parking spot
No pot to piss; they watched me rot
I was rotting in my grave I thought
But it was back to reality; it catches me softly
Screaming death to my enemies we paint this often
It's a mission just to know I hate every human living

Buckle yourself down; life is a ride
Find a purpose; buy your time

Brace for an impact; pray for a change
Hope your God can help your stay
Throwing a punch now; picking a fight
Do you sleep alone most nights?
How 'bout this weather? Look at the sun
Heard tomorrow rain might come
I didn't notice; notice the fall
I got lost between the fall
I am lost between this all

This place looks like everything you wanted
Red roses; white doves and such
Church wedding bells; the hell is she thinkin' there's no green around her finger from us
I came to this place fully conscious
Well aware that my actions are unjust
That man up there said I'd have to hold my peace forever
Unless something is said now and stand up
That's the reason I came here in the first place
So forgive me for what I'm to say
After so many years forever and ever
Turned into bad weather today

And the rain came down
Washed away all that he'd found
What's the reason for keeping them around
Can't place them together
That house on the hill there's a prison
Spent too many years turned to hell
Oh how if those old walls could listen and hear me
Oh how much these old walls could tell
As and old man I know I should reason
But I could torch this old place might as well
With a can full of diesel and a booklet of matches
Let's see what these ashes unveil

And the rain came down
Washed away all that he'd found
What's the reason for keeping them around
Can't place them together
Yeah the rain came down
Washed away all that he'd found
What's the reason for keeping them around
Blow over Bad Weather

The greatest fears stem from mum and dad
So I just do the best with whatever I have
Can't do more than that
Listen here; son; don't resort to violence
There's more powerful tools to be found in silence than that
No; don't resort to that

When did peace and love become police and handcuffs?

Stop
Don't let the needle touch the track
Or there's gonna be sparks from our backs
'Cause if you play it post-2 o'clock
Someone always does the headbutt rock
(There's always someone) Doing the headbutt rock
(There's always someone) Doing the headbutt rock
(There's always someone) Doing the headbutt rock
(There's always one)

Come here; son; sit on my knee
If you play with dogs expect to come up in fleas
Come up in fleas
I lived to fight the very next day
If on the day before I lived to run; run away
Run; run away

When did peace and love
Become police and handcuffs?
When push turns to shove
Surely; you've got to man up

Stop
Don't let the needle touch the track
Or there's gonna be sparks from our backs
'Cause if you play it post-2 o'clock
Someone always does the headbutt
Don't let the needle touch the track
Or there's gonna be sparks from our backs

Scared they're falling off and take it out on me

(This is something; falling in love with my best friend)
Falling in love with my best friend
(Loving; loving; falling in love with my best friend)

If I had to be anywhere with anybody
You can believe I'd choose you

And now we're telling jokes on the back of my scooter
We've been talking about our love since a little past 4 AM
So morning coffee at the cafe
Morning coffee at the cafe
Have to leave but would you please stay?
'Cause I've been; I've been; I've been
Falling in love with my best friend
(This is something; falling in love with my best friend)
Falling in love with my best friend
(Loving; loving; falling in love with my best friend)

If I had to be anywhere with anybody
You can believe I'd choose you

A smoky bar on the wrong side of town
Or a scratched up vinyl a 45 spinnin' round
Ice in a glass; waitin' on a splash of something cool from Tennessee

Some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey

A little burn ain't such a bad; bad thing; no
A little edge off and just let it be; yeah
A turn up the night; turn on an old memory

Some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey; yeah

That's right...

Now; listen

Like those tired of the world you know wrong kind of days
The ones when you're down in the dumps
Between a rock and a hard place
On the hood of a car; where her eyes are like stars
She caught me off guard when she kissed me
Ya know some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey; yeah

A little burn ain't such a bad; bad thing; no
A little edge off and just let it be; yeah
A turn up the night; turn on an old memory
'Cause some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey; yeah
Some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey

Some things just go better when you mix 'em with whiskey

차가운 바람이 네 머릴 쓰다듬어 I'm all ears
다가 올 이 새벽을 깨워
눈빛으로 긴 밤을 채워
심장이 툭 쿵하고 떨어져 이 느낌
Yes or No 선택은 없어 넌 all day tra-la

아직은 나 조금 서툴지도 몰라
이제는 I wanna tra-la
원하는 대로 다 try ya
믿어볼래 날 부르는 이끌림
이 순간에 담을래

한 걸음 가까이 걸어가면 우릴
그 곳으로 데려다줘
믿을 수 없이 찬란해져 가는
저기 저 별을 따라서

너와 나 tra-la 춤을춰 tra-la

저 하늘 위로 던질거야

꿈속에서만 그렸던 수 많은 날

We lock eyes from far away
And then you slowly turn your face
And we're a secret
There's more to it but we keep it
It's not a game I know
We're just moving at our pace

I remember one time
I remember passing you by
I know now there's no need to hide
Could you be my new love
Could it be that we need some time
I'm still browsing; there's no need to buy

I'm keeping you close you know it
I'm taking my time to show it
You talk to me like you've had it all along
Feels like you're right
And now I notice
I need to draw you closer
Breath away; and I just
Wonder how you keep it all inside

It was on a fair September night
That my lover came to me
I said; ""Darling girl; you're strange to me now
Not like you used to be""
I remember you as a beautiful rose
Out in the morning light
But now your cheeks so silent and pale
And you only walk at night

Oh yes; the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom

Then she left me there as I Iay in a thirst
That water could not quell
And her voice was sad and soft in her throat
As she bid me last farewell

And now the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom

악몽이 밀려와
부딪치고 깨져 상처가 둘러싸
긴 밤을 갈라 지금 난
하늘 위로 높이 떠 오르는 순간
모든 것이 멈춰버린 것 같아
세상은 고요해지고 잠잠해져
작은 구름 뒤에 숨죽인 채
태양이 뜨길 기다려

Ya 처음에는 아주 작고 희미했던 불씨
이제는 거대해져 폭발해버릴 듯이
감출 수 없어 난
가만둘 생각은 No
오래 바라왔던 가장 큰 빛이 돼 주겠어

기다리고 있어 갈증이 번져
저 멀리 날 향한 빛이 보여
아름다워 날 파고들어
내 몸을 감싸와

널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘은 더 크게 요동쳐
환상의 춤을 춰
어둠 속을 뚫고서
겁내지 않아 난 너의 손을 잡아
세상이 날 막는대도
널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘이 터질 듯 요동쳐
Dancing in the dark

차가운 외로움 스며들지
마치 기나긴 저 터널같이
깊숙이 파고들어 나의 날개를 찢어 놓는 듯
혼자선 견딜 수도 참을 수도 없이 고통만 늘어

모든 것이 끝나버린 것 같아
매서운 바람만 휘몰아치는걸
작은 구름 뒤에 숨죽인 채
태양이 뜨길 기다려

자라나고 있어 그리움은 더
저 멀리 날 향한 빛이 보여
운명의 시간 (다가와)
달콤한 꿈이 펼쳐져

널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘은 더 크게 요동쳐
환상의 춤을 춰
어둠 속을 뚫고서
겁내지 않아 난 너의 손을 잡아
세상이 날 막는대도
널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘이 터질 듯 요동쳐
Dancing in the dark

네가 날 비출 때
힘을 내 버틸게 No more pain
마지막 용기가 되어 줄래 내게
새로운 시작은 지금부터 함께해
하나 된 우리는 더욱 밝게 빛을 내
어디든 너와 눈부신 너와
영원하고 싶은걸

널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘은 더 크게 요동쳐
환상의 춤을 춰
어둠 속을 뚫고서
겁내지 않아 난 너의 손을 잡아
세상이 날 막는대도
널 향한 춤을 춰
내 맘이 터질 듯 요동쳐

When the air is quiet
And the sky is blue
I can't help
Being reminded of you

When the air is quiet
And the sky is blue
I can't help
Being reminded of you

And how your eyes are shut
So you cannot see
Just how very close
I keep you to me

And in that dark little place you have made
You'd swear all these pretty clouds are grey
I wonder how you're doin'
How you're doin' now

In a million years
Never thought I'd see
The day you would choose your fear over me
'Cause many storms have come
And if not for you
I'd have been struck down
Disappeared at sea
I know it's hard for you
To take a compliment
But my life began
The day that you came in it

I wonder how you view me how
You view me now

On a night like this
It's just me and the kid
And there's a chair for you where you'd always sit
And we would talk for hours about the dumbest shit
And you would always start my cigarette

I wonder if you ever quit
Like you wanted
I bet you did
I bet you did
I bet you did
I bet you did
How you doing?

'Cause it's never ending; yeah

I turn on the charm and
You're down there on the tarmac
I say something funny
You give me all your money
A flash of my teeth and
You hand your car keys over
A flick of my wrist and
And I seduce your sister

Two faces and friends in high places
I have the sleaze in my teeth
When I move I'm slick
Nothing ever sticks to me

It's never ending; yeah
It's never ending; yeah
The rules keep on bending; yeah
'Cause it's never ending; yeah

I turn on the charm and
You're down there on the tarmac
I say something funny
You give me all your money
A flash of my teeth and
You hand your car keys over
A flick of my wrist and
And I seduce your sister

Keep on pretending; yeah
It's all just pretending; yeah
Rules keep on bending; yeah
So just keep on spending; yeah

I turn on the charm and
You're down there on the tarmac
I say something funny
You give me all your money
A flash of my teeth and
You hand your car keys over
A flick of my wrist and
And I seduce your sister

There's no such thing as good grief
Haven't eaten in three weeks and I'm
Skin and bones when you're not near me
I'm all skeleton and melody

There's no such thing as good grief
Sleep with you in a sex dream and I'm
Pretty sure you don't miss the way
I put all my demons on display
To your pretty music

One more time
Play me something
I won't sing
I'll be quiet
Play me something
One more time
I'm listening

There's no such thing as good grief
Took two months to pack up your things
But I left a box at your parents' house
Don't know whether to feel sad or proud

One more time
Play me something
I won't sing
I'll be quiet
Play me something
One more time
I'm listening

[Korean:]

'띠링'
이따 거기서 보는 거 맞지?
시간 잘 맞춰 늦으면 반칙
시계만 자꾸 보는 걸

난 이미 교복 치마 대신 체육복 바지
복도 끝까지 달려갈 준비
마지막 종소리가 울리면

벌써 저기 오렌지빛 하늘이 짙어지는 걸
어서 머뭇거리다간 금세 어두워질 걸

우린 스케이트보드 위로
마치 춤을 추듯 발을 굴러
바람 그 사이를 가로질러
여기저기 멀리 아주아주 멀리 (저 끝까지)

I'm so good with you
따라와 Catch up!
두 눈을 맞추고; 긴 머리 날리고
Ready; set; go! Feel it
자유로운 기분인 걸

Yo yo yo
지그재그 춤을 춰
Yo yo yo yo
(Tag Me; Tag Me; Tag Me)

Yeah 속도를 올려봐
휘청거리다가 넘어져서 올려다 본 하늘은 Wow
Download 한 phone game보다 짜릿한 이 놀이
같이 만든 우리 Playlist
좀 더 크게 틀어줘

지금 이 순간은 돌아오지 않아
여기 눈부시게 반짝이는 걸
모두 담았어 전부 다 찍었어
앨범 가득한 Video
어디로 튈지 모를 걸

우린 코드가 딱 맞았지 만난 날부터
You know 말을 안 해도 늘 맘이 잘 통하는 걸

우린 스케이트보드 위로
마치 춤을 추듯 발을 굴러
바람 그 사이를 가로질러
여기저기 멀리 아주아주 멀리 (저 끝까지)

I'm so good with you
따라와 Catch up!
두 눈을 맞추고; 긴 머리 날리고
Ready; set; go! Feel it
자유로워 이대로

멈추지 마 저 끝까지 훌쩍 날아가
우린 이제 이곳을 벗어날 거야
그때 마주친 그 표정을 잊을 수 없었지
우린 서로 스며들어 친구보단 또 다른 나인 거 같아
일렁이는 맘을 타고 날아
(Singing winging)

우린 스케이트보드 위로
마치 춤을 추듯 발을 굴러
바람 그 사이를 가로질러
여기저기 멀리 아주아주 멀리 (저 끝까지)

I'm so good with you
따라와 Catch up!
두 눈을 맞추고; 긴 머리 날리고
Ready; set; go! Feel it

I was trumping the jungles; there was nothing to find
No mastodon so that I could be the guy that provides
With empty hands; I headed on home
Live long enough; you're gonna choke on a bone; hey; hey

Hey; hey
That's just the way that it goes

Now I'm sinking in the La Brea Tar Pits
And I don't want to die 'cause there's still so much to give
I'm sinking; could you give me a lift?
Wanna make an escape but don't know where to begin

Each time I let go I sink a little deeper; ah; damn
So let me try to persuade you all to lend me your hand
Good with a spear and settling fights
Do anything for the good of the tribe; hey; hey

Could you throw me a rope?
(Throw me a rope)

'Cause I'm sinking in the La Brea Tar Pits
And I don't want to die 'cause there's still so much to give
I'm sinking; could you give me a lift?
Wanna make an escape but don't know where to begin
