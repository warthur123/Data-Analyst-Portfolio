The coefficient for the linear regression between year and total words in songs is 0.00188. Since this coefficient is positive and the magnitude of the coefficient is very low, we can determine that total song length increases throughout the years, but at a very low rate. 
The coefficient for the linear regression between year and number of unique words in songs is 0.00161. From this coefficient result, we can also conclude that the number of unique words in songs increases throughout the years, but at a rate lower than the rate of growth in number of total words.
Finally, the coefficient for the linear regression between year and the ratio between unique words and total words in songs is -0.0005. This is extremely low, but still has a negative slope, suggesting that the ratio between unique words and total words decreases slightly throughout the years. 
This makes sense since the coefficient for total words is greater than the coefficient for unique words determined by previous linear regression models. When the denominator (total words) grows at a faster rate, the ratio will naturally decrease over time.
